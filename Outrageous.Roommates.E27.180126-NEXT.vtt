1
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.920
(2018 is the Year of the Dog.)

2
00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.221
(A delightful trip of three friends...)

3
00:00:13.121 --> 00:00:15.560
(who were all born in 1970 starts today.)

4
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.401
(Three friends in Hokkaido)

5
00:00:20.531 --> 00:00:21.901
(With the white snow background,)

6
00:00:22.671 --> 00:00:24.470
(their pure romance starts.)

7
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.540
(Romance, my foot.)

8
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.511
(He's falling down.)

9
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.911
(He's an experienced comedian who makes people laugh.)

10
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.680
(Sharing Hokkaido's taste)

11
00:00:38.481 --> 00:00:40.150
(Their instinct of eating...)

12
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.620
(explodes today.)

13
00:00:43.591 --> 00:00:45.391
(This tastes so good.)

14
00:00:45.991 --> 00:00:49.031
(These middle-aged men and woman forgot their ages.)

15
00:00:49.161 --> 00:00:50.161
This is fast!

16
00:00:50.161 --> 00:00:52.661
(They have fun with snow too!)

17
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.101
(Three friends' trip in Hokkaido begins now.)

18
00:00:58.771 --> 00:01:01.411
(Incheon Airport at 7:30am)

19
00:01:02.671 --> 00:01:06.110
(Many people are leaving for their trips from early morning.)

20
00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:10.410
(Sang Ryeol is waiting for his friends alone.)

21
00:01:12.821 --> 00:01:14.891
There are many people who take off since early morning.

22
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.160
(A familiar silhouette appears.)

23
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.360
Hi there, Ms. Oh.

24
00:01:19.791 --> 00:01:21.660
(A familiar friend, Hyeon Gyeong, arrives.)

25
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.291
- Hi. - Hi, it's quite early.

26
00:01:24.531 --> 00:01:26.130
You're pretty even in the morning.

27
00:01:26.401 --> 00:01:27.770
- How have you been? - I didn't wash my hair.

28
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:28.970
- You didn't wash your hair? - No.

29
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.071
- Are you serious? - Yes.

30
00:01:30.841 --> 00:01:32.600
- Let me. - No.

31
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.740
- Let me smell it. It's been long. - No way.

32
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.041
Isn't he Gu Ra over there?

33
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.841
- Why are you entering that way? - What's wrong?

34
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.910
You seem very happy.

35
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.610
- Goodness. - You look very happy.

36
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.321
It's good to see you.

37
00:01:45.321 --> 00:01:47.850
You don't usually look happy seeing me.

38
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.091
- I'm happy to see Ms. Oh. - I knew it.

39
00:01:50.091 --> 00:01:52.061
- He's too happy. - Nothing makes me happy recently.

40
00:01:52.061 --> 00:01:54.061
- You look too happy. - He's always happy to see me.

41
00:01:54.061 --> 00:01:55.561
You're in full bloom.

42
00:01:55.931 --> 00:01:57.330
I know! He's very happy.

43
00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.830
(Full bloom)

44
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.701
Why is he this happy? How have you been, Ms. Oh?

45
00:02:00.701 --> 00:02:01.871
- Hyeon Gyeong. - Yes?

46
00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:03.901
- How have you been? - I've been great.

47
00:02:03.901 --> 00:02:06.740
- Your jacket is cool. - Oh, really?

48
00:02:07.341 --> 00:02:10.141
Isn't it too cold for you to wear only those?

49
00:02:10.411 --> 00:02:13.580
I used to have a huge luggage.

50
00:02:13.941 --> 00:02:18.150
But I gave it to my ex-wife.

51
00:02:18.721 --> 00:02:21.020
- Why would you bring her up? - Why would you talk about her?

52
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.291
Why would you start the day with a sad story?

53
00:02:24.321 --> 00:02:27.291
It's not like you can't say you didn't go to school just because...

54
00:02:27.291 --> 00:02:29.891
your memories of the first grade until high school...

55
00:02:29.891 --> 00:02:31.731
were not so favorable.

56
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.430
How could you compare your family to school days?

57
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.830
- How could you do that? - It's the same thing.

58
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.041
Whether I like it or not, she was part of my life.

59
00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:40.201
How could I not mention her?

60
00:02:40.471 --> 00:02:42.011
- Goodness. - You guys are loud now.

61
00:02:42.011 --> 00:02:44.481
- I didn't make stories up. - It's been half a year.

62
00:02:44.481 --> 00:02:47.511
- No, you said it to me. - We're like a year older now.

63
00:02:47.511 --> 00:02:49.511
You are the one who asked me why my luggage is so small.

64
00:02:49.511 --> 00:02:51.150
- You two are still loud. - I don't have many bags.

65
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.751
You two are so loud. Where are we going?

66
00:02:52.751 --> 00:02:55.090
I only have this at home.

67
00:02:55.891 --> 00:02:57.891
(How old are these men?)

68
00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.960
(49 years old Sang Ryeol)

69
00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.960
(49 years old Gu Ra)

70
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.601
I'll buy you one!

71
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.161
(Smiling in joy)

72
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.001
- Have you all changed money? - I have.

73
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:11.671
- We have to pick a treasurer. - You're right.

74
00:03:11.671 --> 00:03:14.011
- Let's leave it to Ms. Oh. - I don't want to do it today.

75
00:03:14.011 --> 00:03:15.511
- I'll do it today. - Why?

76
00:03:15.511 --> 00:03:16.911
- You want to do it? - I'll do it.

77
00:03:17.011 --> 00:03:18.280
I know Japan well.

78
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.780
I've been to Hokkaido three times.

79
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:20.911
- You've been there many times. - Yes.

80
00:03:20.911 --> 00:03:23.481
- Ice cream there is good. - You're right.

81
00:03:23.481 --> 00:03:24.821
- Ice cream is really good. - Yes, it's good.

82
00:03:24.821 --> 00:03:25.881
The green tea ice cream is good.

83
00:03:25.881 --> 00:03:27.650
- No, the regular one is good. - Yes, the regular one.

84
00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.251
- The milky ice cream is good. - Really?

85
00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:30.990
The lamb meat is also famous.

86
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.421
- Lamb is good. - Lamb rib?

87
00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:35.460
There are some people who can't eat lamb.

88
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.330
- Do you eat it, Ms. Oh? - I don't eat it well, but...

89
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.400
I eat it in nice restaurants.

90
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.631
You have to eat sausages then.

91
00:03:40.201 --> 00:03:41.471
Okay, let's go. Let's go eat sausages.

92
00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:42.671
Let's change money first.

93
00:03:42.671 --> 00:03:44.971
- The flight time is quite close. - Oh, okay.

94
00:03:44.971 --> 00:03:46.971
- Let me help you with it. - No, I can do it.

95
00:03:46.971 --> 00:03:48.110
Is this 900 dollars?

96
00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:50.141
900 dollars in total.

97
00:03:50.141 --> 00:03:51.481
- Okay. - Let's go.

98
00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:52.541
(The three of them leave confidently.)

99
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.110
(Taking off right away)

100
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.751
(Or not)

101
00:03:59.421 --> 00:04:03.150
(Their flight is delayed due to the airport congestions.)

102
00:04:06.421 --> 00:04:10.460
(After two hours...)

103
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.471
(They finally left for Hokkaido.)

104
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.641
(4:00pm at Shin-Chitose Airport)

105
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.540
How could our flight get delayed?

106
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.241
It's 4pm now.

107
00:04:25.511 --> 00:04:28.910
- The sun's going to set soon. - Where shall we go?

108
00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.780
If we're going to the downtown, we should take the train.

109
00:04:31.881 --> 00:04:33.381
- The train system is nice. - You know this place well, right?

110
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.850
- Let's move by the subway. - Sure.

111
00:04:34.951 --> 00:04:36.621
- Let's get on the JR line. - Okay.

112
00:04:36.621 --> 00:04:38.361
It's not JR. JR is not found here.

113
00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:40.491
JR is an express train...

114
00:04:40.491 --> 00:04:42.030
like KTX in Korea.

115
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.530
- It isn't connected? - No.

116
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:44.900
- We have to get out of here. - Yes.

117
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.301
- You've been here before. - JR is like KTX.

118
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.330
- We're arrived here too late. - I know.

119
00:04:49.431 --> 00:04:52.871
- Where shall we go? - The downtown is quite small.

120
00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.511
- It's small. - Right.

121
00:04:55.511 --> 00:04:56.970
I've been there before.

122
00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.580
I'm good with directions.

123
00:04:58.941 --> 00:05:01.181
I just skimmed through, and I got the roads already.

124
00:05:01.181 --> 00:05:04.181
It's good to take photos near the clock tower.

125
00:05:04.181 --> 00:05:05.350
- Okay. - They also have...

126
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.520
- beer festivals in summer. - You're right.

127
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.821
They also have this spot...

128
00:05:10.821 --> 00:05:15.391
known for one of Japan's early sea ports.

129
00:05:15.391 --> 00:05:16.530
It's nice there.

130
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.061
(Gu Ra is showing off his knowledge about things.)

131
00:05:19.061 --> 00:05:22.431
(He said it's not the JR line, but it is.)

132
00:05:23.431 --> 00:05:27.170
- Look! It says JR! - Yes, it's JR, but...

133
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.571
I said I was wrong, and you're right.

134
00:05:30.681 --> 00:05:31.941
Why do you have to point it out?

135
00:05:31.941 --> 00:05:33.881
I said you were right about JR.

136
00:05:33.881 --> 00:05:36.181
He's like a walking court.

137
00:05:36.381 --> 00:05:38.121
- He's judging everything. - I know.

138
00:05:38.121 --> 00:05:39.650
- His knowledge is shallow. - I said you were right.

139
00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.290
Where are you going?

140
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.090
We have to go to downtown Sapporo.

141
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.561
I think the subway lines here...

142
00:05:45.561 --> 00:05:47.991
are all written in Japanese.

143
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.660
- Tell us about this. - How can we go now?

144
00:05:49.931 --> 00:05:51.501
How do we go to Sapporo Station?

145
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.701
Is this one correct?

146
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.431
- You can just select it here. - Okay.

147
00:05:55.431 --> 00:05:58.141
I can just get the tickets by the prices?

148
00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:59.941
- It's here. - Oh, right.

149
00:05:59.941 --> 00:06:01.540
- The yellow block. - It's 10 dollars.

150
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.141
(Finally getting tickets)

151
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.381
(Getting tickets one by one)

152
00:06:07.381 --> 00:06:09.910
- It's here. One. Take it. - Okay.

153
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.150
This reminds me of the old days.

154
00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.590
- Yes, this paper ticket is old. - We had something like this too.

155
00:06:14.691 --> 00:06:17.220
We got this paper ticket from the assistant at the counter.

156
00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.321
- Then we tell where we're going. - Yes.

157
00:06:19.691 --> 00:06:21.431
It used to be like that. This sign is funny.

158
00:06:21.431 --> 00:06:24.131
It's asking how many children you're travelling with.

159
00:06:24.131 --> 00:06:25.261
(Cute buttons showing the travellers)

160
00:06:25.261 --> 00:06:26.660
- It's very cute. - Yes.

161
00:06:26.761 --> 00:06:29.330
- It's like two adults. - This is us, right?

162
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.301
- This is me. - You are this.

163
00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:32.701
You're single here because you don't have a child.

164
00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:34.311
(The two friends with kids are making Sang Ryeol speechless.)

165
00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:35.540
- Guys. - What have you done?

166
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.071
- Am I wrong? - Why didn't you make a child?

167
00:06:37.071 --> 00:06:39.311
Hyeon Gyeong and I belong to this button with a child.

168
00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:40.850
- Sang Ryeol is single. - Let's hear him out.

169
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:41.910
What's wrong with you?

170
00:06:42.011 --> 00:06:43.811
This is depressing.

171
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.621
- Is the train here? - Yes, it's here.

172
00:06:46.621 --> 00:06:48.420
- We have to go now. - Okay.

173
00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:49.491
- To Sapporo. - This way.

174
00:06:49.491 --> 00:06:50.720
Are we going?

175
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.131
(It takes about 30 minutes to the downtown by train.)

176
00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:56.290
(Hello.)

177
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.371
(This man has a long chin.)

178
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:02.871
Are you Chinese?

179
00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:04.501
- I'm from Taiwan. - Oh, Taiwan.

180
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:09.111
As we have some conditions for our moving in,

181
00:07:09.111 --> 00:07:12.080
we should do something together during our trip.

182
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.580
Let's do two things together as housemates while traveling.

183
00:07:13.741 --> 00:07:14.951
- Gu Ra. - Just two each.

184
00:07:14.951 --> 00:07:16.551
- These are my conditions. - I feel bad.

185
00:07:16.551 --> 00:07:18.621
- In downtown, Sapporo, - I like it.

186
00:07:18.621 --> 00:07:20.350
- there's a pretty clock tower. - I like it.

187
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:22.121
- Okay, okay. - We can take a photo there.

188
00:07:22.121 --> 00:07:24.020
- Let's look around and take photos. - I'd love that.

189
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.460
We should take a lot of photos there.

190
00:07:26.191 --> 00:07:29.790
(Gu Ra wants to make unforgettable memories with his friends.)

191
00:07:30.391 --> 00:07:33.330
- Dairy products are famous here. - Okay.

192
00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.830
- Actually, ice cream is famous. - Really?

193
00:07:36.131 --> 00:07:39.371
Ice cream is one of the food we should try here.

194
00:07:39.371 --> 00:07:42.611
- My conditions are... - My conditions aren't that special.

195
00:07:42.611 --> 00:07:44.210
- They are great. What about you? - I mean...

196
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:46.011
- Right. - Enjoying a proper hot spring.

197
00:07:46.011 --> 00:07:47.181
You like hot springs.

198
00:07:47.181 --> 00:07:48.611
- That's a great one. - I like hot springs too.

199
00:07:48.611 --> 00:07:49.980
Hot springs are great here.

200
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:51.580
- I agree. They are great. - Hot springs.

201
00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.121
- Even if it's for a short while, - Right.

202
00:07:53.121 --> 00:07:55.691
- it's relaxing. - You're right. Of course.

203
00:07:55.691 --> 00:07:57.220
We should definitely try that. Hot springs are great.

204
00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.590
- You also wrote that down. - You wrote that too.

205
00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:00.761
I also wrote that we should enjoy a hot spring just like Hyeon Gyeong.

206
00:08:00.761 --> 00:08:02.160
I like this condition.

207
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.761
- As I said, since we are here, - You're right.

208
00:08:04.761 --> 00:08:08.730
we should visit at least three restaurants to try their food.

209
00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:11.100
Most of the restaurants in Japan have a long history that dates...

210
00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.540
- back as far as 100 or 200 years. - That's right.

211
00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.910
I like hot springs. Near this area...

212
00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:17.311
Did you get some sleep by the way?

213
00:08:17.311 --> 00:08:19.741
I slept for about 4 hours. It was a bit more than 4 hours.

214
00:08:19.741 --> 00:08:23.210
I have a question for you, Hyeon Gyeong.

215
00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:26.881
I noticed that as I get older, I don't sleep as much as before.

216
00:08:27.391 --> 00:08:29.691
- You're not that old yet. - I sleep a lot by nature.

217
00:08:29.691 --> 00:08:31.460
No. I think I can feel the difference now.

218
00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.820
- No, I'm not there yet. - I can't sleep deeply. That's it.

219
00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.731
- Right. That's true. - I can't sleep deeply.

220
00:08:35.991 --> 00:08:38.030
It's because our breathing...

221
00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:40.160
- That is so true. - gets weaker. That's why.

222
00:08:40.501 --> 00:08:41.831
- I completely agree. - You're right.

223
00:08:41.831 --> 00:08:43.030
- What is it? - You're right.

224
00:08:43.131 --> 00:08:44.670
- I mean... - That's so true.

225
00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:47.300
the herbalists often mention this.

226
00:08:47.341 --> 00:08:48.810
I actually experienced that.

227
00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:50.881
- I know what you mean. - When I was sleeping,

228
00:08:50.881 --> 00:08:52.841
- I wished that I'd sleep deeply. - It's because...

229
00:08:52.841 --> 00:08:54.511
- I felt that. - That's...

230
00:08:54.511 --> 00:08:57.351
- The weather is cold too. - All my hairs rose.

231
00:08:57.351 --> 00:09:00.621
You know the diaphragm in our body?

232
00:09:00.621 --> 00:09:02.920
Only our diaphragms are horizontal while everything else is vertical.

233
00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:06.190
When you're young, it is on the bottom, but it begins to rise later.

234
00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:09.491
When we get older, our body shrinks, and that's why it moves up.

235
00:09:09.491 --> 00:09:11.601
So that's why you should exercise...

236
00:09:11.601 --> 00:09:13.261
- and square our shoulders. - That's true.

237
00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:16.001
- So we easily wake up from sleep. - You're right.

238
00:09:16.001 --> 00:09:17.101
It's our breathing.

239
00:09:17.101 --> 00:09:18.770
(He only talks about what he heard from others.)

240
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.910
I'm half a doctor.

241
00:09:21.511 --> 00:09:23.641
Hey, you should open a practice for bone setting.

242
00:09:23.641 --> 00:09:25.940
- He also likes medicine. - He's pretty knowledgeable.

243
00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.881
It's the same for our heart and brain.

244
00:09:28.881 --> 00:09:30.981
They move through electric shocks.

245
00:09:30.981 --> 00:09:32.150
Heat is the worst enemy for hair loss.

246
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:33.991
That's why people who work out a lot lose their hair.

247
00:09:33.991 --> 00:09:35.621
When the gall bladder heats up...

248
00:09:35.621 --> 00:09:38.221
When you get tired, the intraocular pressure increases.

249
00:09:38.221 --> 00:09:39.290
It's something like that.

250
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:43.030
A friend of a friend of friend...

251
00:09:43.731 --> 00:09:44.761
This is so funny.

252
00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:49.030
People at our age only talk about health. Nothing else.

253
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:50.270
- We do. - I know.

254
00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.540
I've been talking a lot, so I'm starving.

255
00:09:52.641 --> 00:09:54.910
You were the only one talking so far.

256
00:09:55.141 --> 00:09:57.611
I know. I'm the only one talking.

257
00:09:58.641 --> 00:10:01.780
Hey, we should eat some lamb. I'm about to starve to death.

258
00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:04.920
How about going for sushi instead of lamb?

259
00:10:05.251 --> 00:10:08.091
- This area is famous for lamb. - Lamb?

260
00:10:08.091 --> 00:10:10.121
Let's eat some lamb and get ice cream next.

261
00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:13.660
- I don't think she likes lamb. - Is that so?

262
00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:14.660
No, that's not true.

263
00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:16.831
I can eat it as long as it doesn't smell bad.

264
00:10:16.831 --> 00:10:19.430
Yeom Gyeong Hwan loves lamb. Did you know?

265
00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:20.770
- Do you know why? - Why?

266
00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:22.770
It's because it's good for stamina. He stuffs his face with it.

267
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:25.141
Seriously. That guy would eat anything for it.

268
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.940
Hey, have you seen him recently?

269
00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:31.410
I talked to him on the phone a while ago, but I haven't seen him.

270
00:10:32.011 --> 00:10:35.550
(They're heading to Sapporo Station from the airport.)

271
00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:37.111
- We have arrived. - Hey, it's cold here.

272
00:10:37.111 --> 00:10:38.420
- It's cold. - Goodness.

273
00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:41.491
The weather is so different from the airport.

274
00:10:41.491 --> 00:10:42.820
It's freezing here.

275
00:10:43.721 --> 00:10:44.961
It's too cold to be out.

276
00:10:44.961 --> 00:10:46.961
- It's cold. Wear your jackets. - It's cold.

277
00:10:46.961 --> 00:10:48.261
No, I'm wearing this.

278
00:10:48.261 --> 00:10:49.290
- What is that? - What is it?

279
00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:50.631
I should wear a mask. It's cold.

280
00:10:51.731 --> 00:10:53.400
(Gu Ra has disappeared.)

281
00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:55.800
Are you Captain Um Hong Gil?

282
00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:56.900
What are you talking about?

283
00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:58.400
- That's for his neck. - My gosh.

284
00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.440
Are we going for a hike? You don't need to wear that.

285
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.841
It's too cold. I must wear this.

286
00:11:01.841 --> 00:11:03.711
- Let's go. - It's cold.

287
00:11:03.711 --> 00:11:04.841
It's freezing.

288
00:11:09.581 --> 00:11:13.881
(The trip of the trio born in the 70s is kicked off...)

289
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:22.361
(with a night in Sapporo full of city lights.)

290
00:11:23.091 --> 00:11:24.361
Let's get going.

291
00:11:24.361 --> 00:11:27.430
But I get the feeling Hyeon Gyeong doesn't want to eat lamb.

292
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:29.300
- I want to eat lamb. It's not that. - They serve other dishes too.

293
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.601
They serve other food too.

294
00:11:30.601 --> 00:11:32.300
- Such as? - They serve sausages and beef too.

295
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:33.540
- That's nice then. - Exactly.

296
00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:36.270
- I like lamb. - I think she eats lamb though.

297
00:11:36.741 --> 00:11:38.711
Gyeong Hwan even eats lamb that doesn't even taste good.

298
00:11:38.711 --> 00:11:41.081
- My gosh. - I bet he eats tires too.

299
00:11:41.111 --> 00:11:43.511
- He'd eat them with chojang. - But the thing is...

300
00:11:43.511 --> 00:11:44.550
- But... - Did you know that?

301
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:46.950
I learned that the economy in Japan is in good shape now.

302
00:11:47.081 --> 00:11:48.450
I went to Tokyo a while ago.

303
00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:50.920
- It's on the rise now. - They are doing well.

304
00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:51.920
The businesses are roaring.

305
00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.991
- I thought they were struggling. - Seven million Koreans came here.

306
00:11:54.991 --> 00:11:56.660
- That's right. To Japan. - They came to Japan.

307
00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.601
But only 1.9 million Japanese travelled to Korea.

308
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:04.101
Do you work at a traveling agency? Is that it?

309
00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.001
- He may be working at the company. - Hey.

310
00:12:06.001 --> 00:12:08.011
- He knows a lot of things. - Of course.

311
00:12:08.011 --> 00:12:09.111
There's a taxi.

312
00:12:09.111 --> 00:12:10.141
(A taxi stop in front of the station)

313
00:12:10.141 --> 00:12:11.780
That's a taxi from the old days.

314
00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:13.641
That's a hybrid car. Excuse me.

315
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:14.981
- Where is he going? - What?

316
00:12:15.211 --> 00:12:17.520
- Oh, there? - He wants us to stand there.

317
00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:20.751
- He wants us to stand at the stop. - Excuse me.

318
00:12:21.351 --> 00:12:23.820
- Thank you. - Thank you.

319
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:27.891
(They load their luggage in the trunk of the car.)

320
00:12:27.891 --> 00:12:29.560
- Get in. - Gosh.

321
00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:31.160
Beer garden, please.

322
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:33.231
- Beer garden? - Yes, please.

323
00:12:33.231 --> 00:12:35.831
(They head to the lamb restaurant at last!)

324
00:12:36.471 --> 00:12:40.371
The city is quite small and has a lot of cute places.

325
00:12:40.971 --> 00:12:42.410
- I see. - My gosh.

326
00:12:43.371 --> 00:12:47.211
Didn't Lee Byung Hun film a music video here?

327
00:12:47.511 --> 00:12:48.581
In this city, right?

328
00:12:48.581 --> 00:12:51.650
(In Jo Sung Mo's music video for "Immortal Love",)

329
00:12:52.721 --> 00:12:54.820
(he tried to stop his lover from leaving...)

330
00:12:55.721 --> 00:13:00.261
(as he slid frantically in this very city.)

331
00:13:00.591 --> 00:13:02.391
- This is the city, isn't it? - It wasn't Byung Hun's music video.

332
00:13:02.391 --> 00:13:03.831
It was a music video.

333
00:13:03.831 --> 00:13:05.961
He starred as the main character in a singer's music video.

334
00:13:05.961 --> 00:13:08.200
- It was Jo Sung Mo. - You should've mentioned that.

335
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.471
Hey, try not to pick on what I say.

336
00:13:10.871 --> 00:13:11.971
Hey.

337
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.040
- Look at the snow here. Gosh. - Look over there.

338
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.841
It did snow a lot here. Look at the side.

339
00:13:16.841 --> 00:13:18.280
- I know, right? - They even shoveled it.

340
00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.810
(The snow has built up on the streets.)

341
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:24.680
(Glancing)

342
00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.420
Hey, you're blocking the light entirely.

343
00:13:28.491 --> 00:13:29.920
(What?)

344
00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.891
Gu Ra, then can I shrink myself...

345
00:13:32.891 --> 00:13:34.731
- like I'm a pair of pants? - Just move back.

346
00:13:34.731 --> 00:13:35.930
- Move your head back. - Our faces can't be seen.

347
00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:37.530
- Just move back your head. - People can't see our faces.

348
00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:38.861
- They can't see us. - Keep your head back.

349
00:13:38.861 --> 00:13:40.131
There's nothing I can do about my height.

350
00:13:40.131 --> 00:13:41.670
- Move your head back. - Look at that.

351
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.371
- Put your head where it was before. - Just like that.

352
00:13:44.371 --> 00:13:45.900
- You can't do that. - You're blocking the light.

353
00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:47.841
- No. Our faces can't be seen. - Actresses depend on lightings.

354
00:13:47.841 --> 00:13:49.471
- They can't see us then. - My gosh.

355
00:13:49.471 --> 00:13:51.711
- Move back, so she gets the light. - How could you be so clueless?

356
00:13:51.711 --> 00:13:54.081
You two should come alone next time.

357
00:13:54.081 --> 00:13:56.511
- Don't bring me then. - There's no fun in that then.

358
00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:57.920
We won't tell you.

359
00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.751
Am I your pet or something? Am I?

360
00:14:00.751 --> 00:14:02.351
That was good. The analogy was cute.

361
00:14:02.351 --> 00:14:04.461
Do you see what I mean? You always evaluate what I say.

362
00:14:04.461 --> 00:14:05.820
It was a cute one.

363
00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:09.261
This restaurant is the one that serves lamb.

364
00:14:09.261 --> 00:14:12.900
Look at that. That's so pretty. How beautiful.

365
00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:15.371
They renovated a beer factory.

366
00:14:15.371 --> 00:14:18.940
- There's a beer museum over there. - Goodness.

367
00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:20.341
This is great.

368
00:14:20.341 --> 00:14:22.871
We came to the right place, Hyeon Gyeong.

369
00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:26.211
- Look at the decor. - It's like a stand-up bar.

370
00:14:26.211 --> 00:14:27.241
- I like that. - Is it big?

371
00:14:27.241 --> 00:14:29.280
- It's big like a square. - I love it.

372
00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.550
We must get going.

373
00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:33.180
- I love it. This is so pretty. - I like this place.

374
00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:35.991
- How could I have never come here? - It's a famous restaurant.

375
00:14:35.991 --> 00:14:37.790
- It has a great vibe. - I love this smell.

376
00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:39.690
The smell.

377
00:14:40.221 --> 00:14:42.131
(From the entrance...)

378
00:14:42.131 --> 00:14:44.331
- This is nice. - Let's go inside.

379
00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:46.131
- It smells divine here. - Should we go in more?

380
00:14:46.361 --> 00:14:47.530
- It smells great here. - My gosh,

381
00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:49.900
- I think I am a glutton. - We'll take this.

382
00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:51.501
It smells delicious.

383
00:14:51.501 --> 00:14:52.770
(The caldron lid has the master's touch.)

384
00:14:53.341 --> 00:14:57.410
(The smell of the meat makes their mouths water.)

385
00:14:58.211 --> 00:14:59.981
(Welcome)

386
00:14:59.981 --> 00:15:03.211
- I took a look at the menu. - Okay.

387
00:15:03.211 --> 00:15:06.520
Do you see this? "Lamb shoulders".

388
00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:07.991
- Let's get the lamb shoulders. - Okay.

389
00:15:07.991 --> 00:15:10.320
We'll have a cold glass of beer.

390
00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.891
Let's eat this before we eat lamb.

391
00:15:11.891 --> 00:15:13.361
- Are those onions? - Yes, fried onion rings.

392
00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:15.560
- Okay. I bet that's good. - What do you think? Do you like it?

393
00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.900
Are you okay with that? How about it?

394
00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:19.660
Hey, are you asking for our opinions?

395
00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:21.530
- Or do you just want to eat them? - No, no.

396
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:23.331
- I'm asking your opinions. - Let me see that too.

397
00:15:23.331 --> 00:15:24.800
- Let's order first. - Let us take a look.

398
00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:25.900
- Hey. - Excuse me.

399
00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.670
- Let us look at the menu first. - Let's get beer first.

400
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:29.511
- Fine, fine. - Excuse me.

401
00:15:29.511 --> 00:15:30.741
We'd like to order.

402
00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:34.650
(He starts ordering the dishes he decided on earlier.)

403
00:15:35.011 --> 00:15:36.680
(You'd better ask for our opinions properly this time.)

404
00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:38.381
Do you want sausages?

405
00:15:38.381 --> 00:15:39.420
(Ta-da)

406
00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:41.050
- Well... - We'll have some sausages.

407
00:15:42.121 --> 00:15:43.950
(I can't let this slide.)

408
00:15:45.361 --> 00:15:47.391
Hey, you should ask her what she wants.

409
00:15:47.391 --> 00:15:49.231
- I was asking the both of you. - No, you want to eat them.

410
00:15:49.231 --> 00:15:51.601
This is what you did. You saw sausages, and said, "Sausages?"

411
00:15:51.601 --> 00:15:53.530
- We can't say no when you do that. - Earlier today,

412
00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:55.731
we settled on this.

413
00:15:55.731 --> 00:15:57.670
She said that she wanted to eat sausages.

414
00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:02.310
("3 Friends, the Return of the 70s")

415
00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:06.180
Two glasses of draft beer, please.

416
00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:07.851
(Only two glasses?)

417
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:10.280
- Why did you only order two? - What does that mean?

418
00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:12.020
(She understood.)

419
00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:14.491
- Just get 2. Forget his. - Only 2?

420
00:16:14.621 --> 00:16:15.851
- Come on. - What?

421
00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:17.560
- Seriously. - What's going on?

422
00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.891
- Come on. You should know better. - What is it?

423
00:16:20.091 --> 00:16:22.030
(Immature Sang Ryeol wasn't going to order Gu Ra's beer.)

424
00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:25.131
(Meanwhile, Gu Ra finishes ordering 3 glasses of beer.)

425
00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:28.101
- He learned it. - Thank you.

426
00:16:28.101 --> 00:16:29.831
Were you going to pull a trick on me?

427
00:16:29.831 --> 00:16:32.501
My gosh, I was here when you ordered.

428
00:16:32.501 --> 00:16:33.540
- What do you mean? - Unbelievable.

429
00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:35.211
What were you going to do with two glasses of beer?

430
00:16:35.211 --> 00:16:36.471
- I... - Hey, you'll spill it.

431
00:16:36.471 --> 00:16:39.341
I was going to play along, but it was just too childish.

432
00:16:39.341 --> 00:16:41.550
If she only brought two, I could have just...

433
00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:43.910
ordered another one.

434
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:45.150
He didn't think that far.

435
00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:47.721
Don't you see that? I could have easily done that.

436
00:16:47.721 --> 00:16:49.650
- He got excited about that. - Right, right.

437
00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:51.221
- When I pointed that out... - Fine.

438
00:16:51.221 --> 00:16:52.861
- I like lamb. - We're eating lambs,

439
00:16:52.861 --> 00:16:54.461
- I like lamb. - so you guys have been lame.

440
00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:57.290
(If only we didn't hear his joke...)

441
00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:58.331
(What should I do?)

442
00:16:58.331 --> 00:17:01.331
Hey, did you know? When we are done with our meal,

443
00:17:01.331 --> 00:17:02.530
we can burn this up.

444
00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:04.141
(He's joking.)

445
00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:05.601
Why?

446
00:17:05.601 --> 00:17:07.841
(Since when did we decide to do that?)

447
00:17:08.871 --> 00:17:12.010
Was his joke funny to you? Was it funny?

448
00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:13.510
- I saw you getting flustered. - Wasn't it funny?

449
00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:14.851
Isn't it funny?

450
00:17:14.851 --> 00:17:16.680
Why would you burn it? I was just joking.

451
00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.750
- We have to burn it? - Yes. We have to burn it.

452
00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:21.851
- You have to set this on fire. - Let's burn it.

453
00:17:21.851 --> 00:17:24.660
We're going to get covered in oil. So let's just burn it.

454
00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:26.220
- She's laughing. - I enjoyed it.

455
00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:27.430
She enjoyed it.

456
00:17:27.561 --> 00:17:30.490
- She's a strange woman. - What's so strange?

457
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.760
Next time, you should come here with Gyeong Hwan.

458
00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.200
("Three Friends" end.)

459
00:17:35.031 --> 00:17:37.440
(Finally, the draft beer is served.)

460
00:17:39.771 --> 00:17:42.071
- This is fun. - Thank you.

461
00:17:42.071 --> 00:17:43.371
This is classic.

462
00:17:43.371 --> 00:17:44.480
This is classic.

463
00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.881
(Thirsty, they gulp it down.)

464
00:17:47.881 --> 00:17:49.881
- Isn't it delicious? - It's so refreshing.

465
00:17:50.611 --> 00:17:52.781
- The water tastes good. - It's clean water.

466
00:17:52.851 --> 00:17:55.490
The water tastes amazing. This is water.

467
00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.420
They're known for good water.

468
00:17:57.690 --> 00:17:59.660
Water tastes the best...

469
00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:01.531
in night clubs.

470
00:18:01.531 --> 00:18:02.831
(Laughing)

471
00:18:03.331 --> 00:18:04.660
(Did we hear it wrong?)

472
00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:06.200
- Why aren't you criticizing her? - I am not laughing.

473
00:18:06.561 --> 00:18:07.900
- Why aren't you criticizing her? - When you...

474
00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.230
When you don't laugh, she'd know. Do I have to criticize her?

475
00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:12.371
- I laughed. That's what matters. - Right.

476
00:18:12.371 --> 00:18:13.771
- I was embarrassed. - I didn't laugh.

477
00:18:13.801 --> 00:18:15.311
I laughed my own joke.

478
00:18:15.311 --> 00:18:16.541
(Gyeong Hwan, I need you here.)

479
00:18:17.811 --> 00:18:19.980
- Japan is nice. - She likes these things.

480
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.680
- Amazing. - First,

481
00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:23.881
- She likes them. - Should I put this in the middle?

482
00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:26.051
- Try it, Sang Ryeol. - Sure.

483
00:18:26.051 --> 00:18:27.281
- Take one. - That was so funny.

484
00:18:27.281 --> 00:18:28.291
Have one.

485
00:18:28.621 --> 00:18:30.391
- Come on. Come on. - Okay.

486
00:18:30.391 --> 00:18:32.490
Look how sweet I am. Eat it.

487
00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:34.291
Here. Try it.

488
00:18:34.291 --> 00:18:35.430
(Sang Ryeol tries it.)

489
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:36.430
Isn't it good?

490
00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:38.730
- This is perfect for beer. - This is nice.

491
00:18:40.531 --> 00:18:41.631
- Is it good? - It is.

492
00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:44.740
Whenever I eat something for the first time,

493
00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:46.371
I don't put anything on it.

494
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.041
I taste the ingredient's unique flavor first.

495
00:18:49.041 --> 00:18:50.710
If that's what you want, you shouldn't eat it fried.

496
00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:51.980
You should eat it raw.

497
00:18:52.611 --> 00:18:53.641
What?

498
00:18:53.641 --> 00:18:55.381
(What is he saying?)

499
00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:57.480
- Right. - I am good at barbecuing.

500
00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:58.781
- Right. - I love eating barbecue too.

501
00:18:58.781 --> 00:19:00.521
(Gu Ra grills the meat before they argue again.)

502
00:19:01.551 --> 00:19:03.091
Don't grill too much at once.

503
00:19:03.091 --> 00:19:04.391
Okay.

504
00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:07.061
This will tip off.

505
00:19:07.061 --> 00:19:08.960
(The lamb meat gets cooked to Sang Ryeol's order.)

506
00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.861
The juice is dripping down.

507
00:19:10.861 --> 00:19:11.930
It looks delicious.

508
00:19:13.301 --> 00:19:14.400
Try it.

509
00:19:15.301 --> 00:19:16.301
(Sang Ryeol serves Gu Ra food this time.)

510
00:19:16.301 --> 00:19:17.341
Try it.

511
00:19:18.141 --> 00:19:19.940
Let's try it.

512
00:19:20.811 --> 00:19:21.811
It's delicious.

513
00:19:21.811 --> 00:19:23.371
- I think the sauce would be good. - The sauce is good.

514
00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:24.410
The sauce is good.

515
00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:26.041
It's delicious.

516
00:19:26.041 --> 00:19:27.141
(Hyeon Gyeong dips her meat in the sauce.)

517
00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:31.420
(Sang Ryeol dips his in the sauce too.)

518
00:19:32.581 --> 00:19:34.220
(It's absolutely delicious.)

519
00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:36.621
Thank you for the food.

520
00:19:36.621 --> 00:19:38.121
- We have to eat it fast. - Try it.

521
00:19:38.121 --> 00:19:39.160
We have to eat it fast.

522
00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:40.361
It's really delicious.

523
00:19:40.361 --> 00:19:41.430
(They eat hurriedly.)

524
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:43.891
- The lamb is really good. - It's really delicious.

525
00:19:43.891 --> 00:19:44.930
It's not bad without the sauce.

526
00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:46.160
It's delicious, isn't it?

527
00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:48.930
I drink beer a lot whenever I come here.

528
00:19:49.031 --> 00:19:50.470
You don't usually drink much.

529
00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:52.000
But I drink quite a lot of beer.

530
00:19:52.571 --> 00:19:54.271
You're drinking quite a lot today.

531
00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:56.571
We ate at 10am.

532
00:19:56.571 --> 00:19:58.881
And we didn't eat anything until 6pm.

533
00:19:58.881 --> 00:20:01.381
We have to be thankful...

534
00:20:01.381 --> 00:20:03.781
that none of us have diabetes.

535
00:20:03.781 --> 00:20:04.851
(We were able to hold it because we were healthy.)

536
00:20:04.851 --> 00:20:06.551
- You know what I mean, right? - We are considered healthy.

537
00:20:06.551 --> 00:20:07.650
- We are. - We are.

538
00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:09.051
- That's what I am saying. - Yes.

539
00:20:09.051 --> 00:20:11.660
If you had diabetes, we should've had chocolates.

540
00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:14.990
I feel like I am going to get diabetic because of you.

541
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:17.331
- Come on. - I am always healthy.

542
00:20:17.331 --> 00:20:19.631
You are healthy.

543
00:20:19.831 --> 00:20:21.470
I haven't told you this,

544
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:22.771
but I have a lot of friends who are hypertensive.

545
00:20:22.771 --> 00:20:23.970
- I am hypertensive. - Really?

546
00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:26.470
- I am hypertensive. - Check your blood sugar level.

547
00:20:26.801 --> 00:20:28.740
A hypertensive person is usually diabetic too.

548
00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.940
- You're just... - That's what doctors say.

549
00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:34.081
- That's what doctors say. - Hey,

550
00:20:34.081 --> 00:20:36.381
why don't you just pay me the condolence money...

551
00:20:36.381 --> 00:20:37.881
- now? - Doctors say that.

552
00:20:37.881 --> 00:20:39.351
Is it something to get upset about?

553
00:20:40.081 --> 00:20:41.291
(She's just joking.)

554
00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:43.791
- I'm serious. - This is great.

555
00:20:43.851 --> 00:20:44.990
I feel so good.

556
00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:47.791
Like I said earlier, we don't talk much,

557
00:20:47.791 --> 00:20:48.990
- but we feel relaxed. - Yes.

558
00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:50.131
- We don't have to talk. - We don't need to.

559
00:20:50.131 --> 00:20:52.301
- I should eat this. - When you travel with your family,

560
00:20:52.801 --> 00:20:55.071
it's not so fun, but you feel relaxed.

561
00:20:55.131 --> 00:20:57.170
You don't talk much, but you feel relaxed.

562
00:20:57.170 --> 00:20:59.371
- I love it. - It's not awkward.

563
00:20:59.371 --> 00:21:00.371
Right.

564
00:21:00.371 --> 00:21:02.910
People like us don't betray each other.

565
00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:03.970
- We don't. - Of course.

566
00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:05.311
- Never. - And we don't...

567
00:21:05.311 --> 00:21:07.581
expect too much from each other.

568
00:21:07.581 --> 00:21:10.051
I am not a sweet type.

569
00:21:10.051 --> 00:21:13.450
- Other people treat us nicely. - Eat this.

570
00:21:13.851 --> 00:21:15.291
(Sang Ryeol doesn't doubt him at all.)

571
00:21:15.291 --> 00:21:16.950
- Eat it. - That's why...

572
00:21:17.091 --> 00:21:20.061
we don't get offended by other people easily.

573
00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:22.391
(He's eating it without any doubt.)

574
00:21:22.561 --> 00:21:23.660
- Is it good? - We have to eat all of these.

575
00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:24.730
It's nice.

576
00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:26.730
You see,

577
00:21:27.061 --> 00:21:28.871
when I bit into it,

578
00:21:28.871 --> 00:21:31.940
the onion came out. So I gave him the skin.

579
00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:33.141
- It's good. - He liked it.

580
00:21:33.141 --> 00:21:34.210
It was good.

581
00:21:35.341 --> 00:21:36.470
It's good.

582
00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:38.910
The onion came out.

583
00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:40.410
So you only got the fried batter.

584
00:21:40.611 --> 00:21:42.010
- He only gave you the skin. - I only gave you the skin.

585
00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:44.150
He only gave you the skin. So he's asking if it was good.

586
00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.250
(Gu Ra is dying.)

587
00:21:46.351 --> 00:21:49.220
He was actually enjoying it.

588
00:21:49.391 --> 00:21:50.621
He's cute. He's naive.

589
00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:52.861
My gosh.

590
00:21:52.861 --> 00:21:54.490
(Their eventful dinner ended.)

591
00:21:56.061 --> 00:21:57.091
(How much is it?)

592
00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.460
This is the bill.

593
00:21:59.801 --> 00:22:01.331
It's around 120 dollars.

594
00:22:01.331 --> 00:22:03.900
I think we would spend this much if we ate this much in Korea.

595
00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:05.170
- It's reasonably priced, isn't it? - It is.

596
00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.871
We can go for some ice cream.

597
00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:09.740
(I love it.)

598
00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:11.480
Let's go.

599
00:22:11.581 --> 00:22:13.311
- Why don't you burn it? - What?

600
00:22:13.311 --> 00:22:14.311
Burn it.

601
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:15.851
I don't have a lighter.

602
00:22:16.381 --> 00:22:18.680
- It's here. - I need to burn it.

603
00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.150
I thought you were serious.

604
00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:21.250
(Hyeon Gyeong is in charge of judging their jokes.)

605
00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:22.450
I get fooled easily.

606
00:22:22.891 --> 00:22:25.490
Give us ice cream

607
00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:26.791
- Give us - Incheon.

608
00:22:26.791 --> 00:22:29.591
- Two ice creams - Incheon.

609
00:22:30.061 --> 00:22:34.301
(Previously, Joong Wan wanted to take a trip to somewhere nice.)

610
00:22:35.271 --> 00:22:36.631
(And they went to an abandoned school.)

611
00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:39.440
(Ong Niel Hwan unexpectedly revealed how naive they are.)

612
00:22:39.801 --> 00:22:42.111
(Will Ong Niel Hwan and Yook Soo have a head-on fight?)

613
00:22:42.571 --> 00:22:44.010
(How will it turn out?)

614
00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:46.841
(It's time to choose the game.)

615
00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:48.750
Let's suggest one game each.

616
00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:50.950
Then let's play rock-paper-scissors and pick two games.

617
00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:52.180
If you don't play, you lose.

618
00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:53.351
Rock-paper-scissors.

619
00:22:53.351 --> 00:22:54.920
(Joong Wan wins.)

620
00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:59.791
I won!

621
00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.561
If you don't play, you lose. Rock-paper-scissors.

622
00:23:01.561 --> 00:23:03.190
(Jae Hwan wins.)

623
00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:04.960
- Yes! - No!

624
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.061
It's table tennis.

625
00:23:07.301 --> 00:23:08.601
Where is the table tennis table? I will go get it.

626
00:23:08.601 --> 00:23:10.470
- It's here. - It's like we're on a school trip.

627
00:23:11.341 --> 00:23:13.000
I haven't had this much fun in a long time.

628
00:23:13.341 --> 00:23:14.710
You seem to like doing these things.

629
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:15.710
I love it.

630
00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:16.970
I love playing games.

631
00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:19.940
The person who wins here...

632
00:23:20.081 --> 00:23:21.210
will be exempted from playing ssireum.

633
00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.781
When the game ends,

634
00:23:23.781 --> 00:23:25.281
the other four will go outside and have a tournament.

635
00:23:25.281 --> 00:23:27.490
I want to win. So should I lose this game?

636
00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:29.150
You want to play ssireum. Is that right?

637
00:23:30.351 --> 00:23:32.561
I think I might lose to Wanna One.

638
00:23:32.561 --> 00:23:33.960
But I will make sure to beat you.

639
00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:36.861
You and I will play first.

640
00:23:37.061 --> 00:23:38.260
The winner will get five points.

641
00:23:41.331 --> 00:23:44.240
(I am Wanna One's center, Kang Daniel.)

642
00:23:45.601 --> 00:23:47.410
(Table tennis is nothing.)

643
00:23:48.811 --> 00:23:52.010
(I am sorry, Jeong Soo. I think I am going to win.)

644
00:23:55.051 --> 00:23:56.081
(They burst into laughter.)

645
00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:58.980
(Daniel precisely hits his nose.)

646
00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:02.051
(He runs to Jeong Soo.)

647
00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:03.351
I am sorry.

648
00:24:05.091 --> 00:24:06.260
I am okay.

649
00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:07.531
I am okay.

650
00:24:07.531 --> 00:24:08.561
(He's dizzy.)

651
00:24:08.561 --> 00:24:10.490
I get one point, right?

652
00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:12.631
I got one point, right?

653
00:24:12.631 --> 00:24:13.831
I think Daniel wants to play ssireum.

654
00:24:13.831 --> 00:24:16.331
- I think he only has the passion. - I think he wants to play it.

655
00:24:16.331 --> 00:24:17.940
I have never played table tennis in my entire life.

656
00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:20.101
- What do I do? - Start.

657
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:25.041
(Downward blow)

658
00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:29.811
He's really terrible at it.

659
00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:31.581
(As soon as Jeong Soo serves the ball,)

660
00:24:31.581 --> 00:24:34.551
(he hits it with a downward blow again.)

661
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:41.031
(He never got to hit a ball more than once.)

662
00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:44.960
- He's terrible. - He is.

663
00:24:45.031 --> 00:24:46.660
- It's 2 to 0. - It's 2 to 0.

664
00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:48.071
- What do I do? - You have to hit the other side.

665
00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:49.571
Okay.

666
00:24:49.571 --> 00:24:51.301
(The ball went out of the table twice more.)

667
00:24:51.371 --> 00:24:52.371
Wait.

668
00:24:52.371 --> 00:24:53.841
(And Jeong Soo wins the first game.)

669
00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:56.141
- I really don't get this. - Put on your jacket.

670
00:24:56.141 --> 00:24:57.680
- I don't know what to do. - Put on your jacket.

671
00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.341
You should go prepare the thigh band.

672
00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:04.121
(Jae Hwan warms up with much charisma.)

673
00:25:04.121 --> 00:25:05.420
- Jae Hwan is good. - What's going on?

674
00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.551
- What are you? - What's going on?

675
00:25:07.551 --> 00:25:09.891
Joong Wan, look at him. You're done.

676
00:25:10.391 --> 00:25:12.920
(Table tennis prodigy threatens Joong Wan.)

677
00:25:13.391 --> 00:25:14.760
- This is unfair. - Why can't you do it?

678
00:25:15.730 --> 00:25:16.930
(Joong Wan is flustered.)

679
00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:19.601
(He seems quiet,)

680
00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:21.000
Come on.

681
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.631
(but he actually turns out to be a table tennis prodigy.)

682
00:25:22.631 --> 00:25:23.670
He's good.

683
00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:26.470
(He practices hard and manages himself well.)

684
00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:29.470
(I am the table tennis prodigy.)

685
00:25:30.071 --> 00:25:31.811
- Next. - This is so difficult.

686
00:25:31.811 --> 00:25:33.041
Do you want to do a practice round?

687
00:25:33.041 --> 00:25:34.180
You should practice.

688
00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:36.781
He's filled with confidence.

689
00:25:36.781 --> 00:25:38.281
- Why? - Look at his posture.

690
00:25:38.281 --> 00:25:40.021
- Let me practice. - Look at his posture.

691
00:25:40.321 --> 00:25:41.321
I'll hit it on the first try.

692
00:25:41.321 --> 00:25:42.450
(They play a practice round.)

693
00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:44.061
(His serve is amazing.)

694
00:25:45.791 --> 00:25:46.861
(What?)

695
00:25:46.861 --> 00:25:47.990
Good job.

696
00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:49.460
Good job.

697
00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:50.960
(His joints don't listen to him.)

698
00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.301
- That's how you do it. - Very graceful.

699
00:25:52.301 --> 00:25:53.331
You move very gracefully.

700
00:25:53.331 --> 00:25:54.771
- His posture is funny. - He moves gracefully.

701
00:25:54.771 --> 00:25:56.131
- He's posture is... - Very graceful.

702
00:25:56.131 --> 00:25:57.301
Let's start now.

703
00:25:57.301 --> 00:25:58.641
- Should I serve first? - Okay.

704
00:25:58.641 --> 00:25:59.771
(The 2nd game starts with Seong Woo's serve.)

705
00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:01.410
Good job. You did well.

706
00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:03.010
He became serious. He became very serious.

707
00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:05.940
But he's played it before. He's done it before.

708
00:26:06.381 --> 00:26:08.210
He's got the eyes of an athlete.

709
00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:10.210
He looks like a Chinese athlete. A Chinese table tennis player.

710
00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:11.250
(He looks like a table tennis world champion.)

711
00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:13.081
- Serve first. - Well done.

712
00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.920
(His serve is good,)

713
00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.121
(but his posture is bad.)

714
00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:19.891
(Seong Woo's joints malfunction.)

715
00:26:22.131 --> 00:26:24.460
(All he did was to shrug his shoulders and frown his face.)

716
00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:25.561
Good job!

717
00:26:26.361 --> 00:26:27.700
Good job!

718
00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:29.470
Good job!

719
00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:30.740
(Jae Hwan falls.)

720
00:26:31.271 --> 00:26:33.301
(The prodigy makes a mistake, and Seong Wu wins 1 point.)

721
00:26:33.301 --> 00:26:37.680
- Good job. - Take off your socks.

722
00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:39.811
You shouldn't be careless.

723
00:26:39.811 --> 00:26:40.811
(He's a table tennis prodigy at heart.)

724
00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:42.750
His postures are so funny.

725
00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:45.581
(Seong Wu's 4 postures will instantly make you feel better.)

726
00:26:46.581 --> 00:26:47.990
(Seong Wu serves again.)

727
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.990
Good job.

728
00:26:49.321 --> 00:26:50.450
(He frowns.)

729
00:26:51.091 --> 00:26:52.821
(He's touched by Seong Wu's cute trick.)

730
00:26:53.791 --> 00:26:56.531
(The prodigy is not stirred at all.)

731
00:26:57.631 --> 00:27:00.561
(It's hard to believe, but he's doing his best.)

732
00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:02.200
Okay.

733
00:27:02.831 --> 00:27:04.440
(He tried hard,)

734
00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.440
(but he lost 1 point.)

735
00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:07.510
(Oh, no.)

736
00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:10.881
(Daniel is rolling on the floor laughing.)

737
00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:14.281
I am crying.

738
00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:16.650
I think I'm going to dream about it.

739
00:27:17.281 --> 00:27:19.051
They played as if they were doing an exorcism.

740
00:27:19.781 --> 00:27:20.791
(Trying to copy Seong Woo.)

741
00:27:20.791 --> 00:27:23.750
They were going like this.

742
00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:24.960
(I liked it.)

743
00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.291
- I'm getting a headache. - My ball...

744
00:27:26.291 --> 00:27:27.460
- I’m crying. - It's my turn to serve.

745
00:27:28.061 --> 00:27:30.061
- How do you do that? - Here I go.

746
00:27:30.061 --> 00:27:31.601
I want to go like this.

747
00:27:31.601 --> 00:27:32.900
- But it’s really fun. - I know.

748
00:27:35.071 --> 00:27:36.430
Come on.

749
00:27:36.601 --> 00:27:38.571
(He stretched out his long arm, but it wasn't enough.)

750
00:27:38.571 --> 00:27:40.400
- 3 to 1. - Have some manner.

751
00:27:41.611 --> 00:27:42.710
(He keeps losing points in funny poses.)

752
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:45.311
- 4 to 1. - 4 to 1.

753
00:27:45.311 --> 00:27:46.811
- He's in trouble. - Okay.

754
00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:50.510
Okay.

755
00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:51.650
(Stretching out)

756
00:27:53.021 --> 00:27:54.791
(Seong Woo lost as he stretches out gracefully.)

757
00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:57.660
He jumped so high.

758
00:27:57.660 --> 00:27:59.291
I thought he was carrying the torch.

759
00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:00.960
The torch.

760
00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.361
I thought he was carrying the torch.

761
00:28:03.861 --> 00:28:05.561
I thought he was carrying the torch.

762
00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:07.500
Are you an honorary ambassador for Pyeongchang Olympics?

763
00:28:09.131 --> 00:28:11.700
(Even though he's not an honorary ambassador...)

764
00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.400
(or a torch bearer,)

765
00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:18.111
(he hopes a successful hosting of Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.)

766
00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:20.111
- You must play. - Yes.

767
00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:21.950
Whoever wins will get to play the final.

768
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:23.150
Rock-paper-scissors.

769
00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:24.581
(Jae Hwan will play the final. Jeong Soo will play against Joong Wan.)

770
00:28:25.821 --> 00:28:28.091
(Jeong Soo's sudden serve)

771
00:28:28.091 --> 00:28:29.150
Wait.

772
00:28:29.851 --> 00:28:31.021
- All of a sudden? - What?

773
00:28:31.021 --> 00:28:32.591
- I'm going to win. - Bring it on.

774
00:28:32.591 --> 00:28:33.760
I'm going to win.

775
00:28:34.561 --> 00:28:35.990
(But he couldn't even pass it over.)

776
00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:38.500
(Then he used all the tricks...)

777
00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:39.760
(to win.)

778
00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.170
This is not table tennis.

779
00:28:42.831 --> 00:28:44.271
I was going to hit it that way.

780
00:28:44.271 --> 00:28:45.871
(I love it.)

781
00:28:46.571 --> 00:28:47.841
Now it's the final.

782
00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:49.271
Start.

783
00:28:49.271 --> 00:28:50.781
(Jae Hwan keeps Joong Wan in check.)

784
00:28:50.781 --> 00:28:52.281
(Walking)

785
00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:54.510
That's good.

786
00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:55.581
Look at him.

787
00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:57.881
(Jae Hwan doesn't serve easily.)

788
00:28:58.220 --> 00:28:59.381
(Then Jae Hwan replicates.)

789
00:28:59.381 --> 00:29:01.150
That's good. Hey.

790
00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:02.720
That's where we spilled pork belly.

791
00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.591
(He serves after confusing Joong Wan.)

792
00:29:05.391 --> 00:29:07.091
(The match is stable as it is the final.)

793
00:29:07.791 --> 00:29:09.660
They're both good.

794
00:29:11.031 --> 00:29:13.531
(A match between table tennis genius and a front runner)

795
00:29:14.371 --> 00:29:15.371
(He misses.)

796
00:29:16.871 --> 00:29:19.240
(He's excited to get a point.)

797
00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:22.210
(The match continues in tension.)

798
00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:25.010
Smashing!

799
00:29:25.281 --> 00:29:27.041
- His legs... - Come on.

800
00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:29.510
- Why does he keep moving his legs? - Show me some smashing.

801
00:29:30.051 --> 00:29:31.821
(He keeps moving.)

802
00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:35.621
(He's playing undisturbed.)

803
00:29:37.091 --> 00:29:38.861
(Concentrating)

804
00:29:39.521 --> 00:29:40.760
Come on, and smash.

805
00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:43.690
- Look at his legs. - Is that Independence Gate or what?

806
00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:45.000
Why are you doing that?

807
00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:46.700
(Joong Wan won 1 point.)

808
00:29:47.301 --> 00:29:48.371
He's going to hit this way.

809
00:29:48.371 --> 00:29:50.000
(He's using a trick like Jeong Soo.)

810
00:29:50.524 --> 00:29:55.524

811
00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:58.410
- Are you doing that again? - His legs.

812
00:29:59.311 --> 00:30:01.811
- Why does he keep moving his legs? - Smashing!

813
00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:03.881
His legs are so funny.

814
00:30:03.881 --> 00:30:05.781
Hey. Why are you so good?

815
00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:07.990
It's like the old eight bits game.

816
00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:09.291
What?

817
00:30:09.291 --> 00:30:11.760
(Eight bits table tennis game continues endlessly.)

818
00:30:13.021 --> 00:30:15.391
Finish it now. Come on.

819
00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:16.660
You're pretty good.

820
00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:18.861
You're good.

821
00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.500
He knows how to play.

822
00:30:20.601 --> 00:30:22.301
(They continue to compliment each other.)

823
00:30:23.631 --> 00:30:25.101
(Laughing)

824
00:30:25.541 --> 00:30:27.101
(He won 1 point again.)

825
00:30:27.271 --> 00:30:29.240
It's making me cry.

826
00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:31.811
(Jae Hwan replicates again.)

827
00:30:31.811 --> 00:30:32.940
(He keeps moving.)

828
00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:38.021
Their cushions are pretty stable.

829
00:30:38.021 --> 00:30:39.180
His legs.

830
00:30:39.621 --> 00:30:41.121
That's hilarious.

831
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:43.321
Can't you smash?

832
00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:44.720
Jae Hwan. Smash.

833
00:30:44.891 --> 00:30:46.690
Come on. Smash already.

834
00:30:47.061 --> 00:30:48.490
Smash now.

835
00:30:48.861 --> 00:30:49.861
(Screaming)

836
00:30:49.861 --> 00:30:51.031
Smash now.

837
00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:52.660
(It's a home run.)

838
00:30:53.331 --> 00:30:55.331
(He won a point without effort.)

839
00:30:56.331 --> 00:30:57.740
(Crying)

840
00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:59.601
Why don't you smash? Try it.

841
00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:01.470
- Why don't you smash? Try it. - Smash?

842
00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:02.811
- Try it. - I get nervous.

843
00:31:02.811 --> 00:31:04.740
- Just do it. - I'm so nervous.

844
00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:06.081
I'm so nervous.

845
00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:09.210
(The current score is 4 to 3.)

846
00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:10.311
Okay.

847
00:31:12.621 --> 00:31:14.591
(Due to the passionate match,)

848
00:31:14.591 --> 00:31:17.051
(they've become exhausted.)

849
00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:19.891
(Okay. I'm going to end this.)

850
00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:21.891
(Jae Hwan's powerful smash)

851
00:31:23.291 --> 00:31:25.200
(Shocking)

852
00:31:26.331 --> 00:31:28.200
(Jae Hwan's smash doesn't give a break.)

853
00:31:29.031 --> 00:31:32.041
(The final winner is Jae Hwan.)

854
00:31:32.041 --> 00:31:33.301
- He was aiming for the last one. - He was so confident.

855
00:31:33.571 --> 00:31:34.970
It's over now.

856
00:31:35.271 --> 00:31:37.581
I should've won.

857
00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:39.740
- I almost had it. - You were pretty good.

858
00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:41.250
Let's pick the loser,

859
00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:43.180
- and grant a wish. - Grant a wish?

860
00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:44.220
The loser grants...

861
00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:45.250
- other four people's wish. - Sounds great.

862
00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:46.950
Sky and ground.

863
00:31:47.281 --> 00:31:48.551
Sky and ground.

864
00:31:48.851 --> 00:31:49.990
We got it.

865
00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:51.420
(Jeong Soo versus Daniel, Joong Wan versus Seong Woo)

866
00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:52.791
- You're going to play first? - It's cold.

867
00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:55.391
Hold on. What are we going to grab?

868
00:31:55.531 --> 00:31:57.291
Grab the underwear.

869
00:31:57.291 --> 00:31:59.331
- "Underwear." - Grab the underwear.

870
00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:00.970
- Here? - Try grabbing it.

871
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:03.831
- Hold my jacket, please. - Give it to me.

872
00:32:04.601 --> 00:32:06.000
It's freezing.

873
00:32:06.101 --> 00:32:07.571
- Are you wearing a T-shirt? - Yes.

874
00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:10.210
- Put something on. - You're tough.

875
00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:12.240
- You're so tough. - Kang Daniel.

876
00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:15.710
- Jeong Soo looks warm. - That's awesome.

877
00:32:17.321 --> 00:32:19.420
- That's awesome. - No. No. No.

878
00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:20.690
No. I'm going to keep the T-shirt on.

879
00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:22.521
Great, Jeong Soo.

880
00:32:23.121 --> 00:32:24.760
No. There's a T-shirt inside.

881
00:32:24.861 --> 00:32:27.021
The T-shirt is stuck.

882
00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:30.801
I'm worried.

883
00:32:30.801 --> 00:32:32.331
I don't know if I should win or lose.

884
00:32:32.331 --> 00:32:35.400
Is Jeong Soo going to throw Daniel down?

885
00:32:35.571 --> 00:32:38.500
No. Daniel's pretty strong.

886
00:32:39.141 --> 00:32:40.571
- Really? - Yes. He's really strong.

887
00:32:41.041 --> 00:32:42.740
- Why is it so low? - Are you strong?

888
00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:44.311
No. Not really.

889
00:32:44.611 --> 00:32:45.781
- Gosh. - Are you okay?

890
00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:47.851
I'm getting nervous.

891
00:32:48.811 --> 00:32:49.950
He's only 20...

892
00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:51.351
(You wouldn't get to see this anywhere else.)

893
00:32:51.351 --> 00:32:53.351
Now, blue band and red band.

894
00:32:53.351 --> 00:32:55.990
- Blue band and red band. - Hurry up. It's cold.

895
00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:00.361
(He's having the biggest worry in his life.)

896
00:33:01.631 --> 00:33:03.831
(Should he win or lose?)

897
00:33:04.101 --> 00:33:08.571
Daniel and Jeong Soo. Start.

898
00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.670
Goodness.

899
00:33:15.641 --> 00:33:16.771
Wait.

900
00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:19.141
(Naive Daniel...)

901
00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:22.551
(displays monstrous power as soon as it begins.)

902
00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.650
(He won against Jeong Soo's strong calves lightly.)

903
00:33:29.091 --> 00:33:30.420
(Real man Daniel wins.)

904
00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:32.561
Oh, it's cold.

905
00:33:35.861 --> 00:33:38.801
You're a real man.

906
00:33:39.101 --> 00:33:40.400
He must be cold.

907
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:42.230
- I'm freezing. - Should I go give this to him?

908
00:33:42.631 --> 00:33:44.670
- Seong Woo. Come out. - Hurry up.

909
00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:46.071
- Seong Woo. - Hurry up.

910
00:33:46.071 --> 00:33:47.141
Come out.

911
00:33:48.141 --> 00:33:50.611
- Seong Woo. Come out. - How can I throw him down?

912
00:33:51.841 --> 00:33:53.940
- I'm not as strong as I look. - Okay.

913
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:56.680
You're double the size of him.

914
00:33:57.321 --> 00:33:58.821
(He's at least triple the size of him.)

915
00:33:58.821 --> 00:34:02.051
He's already dragging me.

916
00:34:02.621 --> 00:34:05.821
- Get ready. Set... - Wait.

917
00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:08.831
(Seong Woo's flapping like thin paper.)

918
00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:10.660
Go.

919
00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:13.930
(Laughing)

920
00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:15.501
(He's lifted up to the air so easily.)

921
00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:18.041
(Seong Woo is too light for Joong Wan.)

922
00:34:18.041 --> 00:34:20.641
- Look at his butt. - Hold onto him.

923
00:34:21.141 --> 00:34:22.211
(My goodness.)

924
00:34:22.211 --> 00:34:23.871
It's an idol singer's butt.

925
00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:26.110
Hold onto him.

926
00:34:26.711 --> 00:34:27.811
Keep holding on.

927
00:34:28.211 --> 00:34:30.720
What's he going to do?

928
00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:32.880
(He soothes Seong Woo in case he's bored.)

929
00:34:33.481 --> 00:34:35.021
(His soul's being threshed.)

930
00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:37.990
(Flapping)

931
00:34:38.791 --> 00:34:39.820
(They're enjoying it despite how he feels.)

932
00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:40.891
Great.

933
00:34:40.891 --> 00:34:42.731
I give up.

934
00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:45.630
(Joong Wan spins.)

935
00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:49.030
I give up.

936
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:51.970
- You won. - Look at that.

937
00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:55.340
- Did I win? - You won.

938
00:34:55.541 --> 00:34:56.671
(Roar of joy)

939
00:34:56.671 --> 00:34:57.981
Why did you fall?

940
00:34:57.981 --> 00:34:59.010
(Joong Wan's still laughing.)

941
00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:00.141
From laughing.

942
00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.311
- Don't be ridiculous. - I was laughing so much.

943
00:35:02.311 --> 00:35:04.680
- Don't be ridiculous. - I fell from laughing as I spun.

944
00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:06.621
(He denies the reality.)

945
00:35:06.751 --> 00:35:08.550
He doesn't cook.

946
00:35:08.751 --> 00:35:10.151
He keeps nagging.

947
00:35:10.351 --> 00:35:14.331
I wanted to throw Jeong Soo down.

948
00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:16.430
(You know that I love you, right, Jeong Soo?)

949
00:35:16.691 --> 00:35:18.130
- We're going to have a match? - Yes.

950
00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:20.030
- It's the rule. - It's going to be funny.

951
00:35:20.231 --> 00:35:21.930
- It's going to be really funny. - It's going to be hilarious.

952
00:35:22.731 --> 00:35:25.401
You said you'll take your clothes off when you go outside.

953
00:35:26.171 --> 00:35:27.570
(When Daniel suggested,)

954
00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:29.910
(he said he will...)

955
00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:31.380
(only wear his underwear.)

956
00:35:32.141 --> 00:35:33.481
Are we really going to do it?

957
00:35:33.481 --> 00:35:34.981
- Go shirtless. - Go shirtless.

958
00:35:35.311 --> 00:35:36.811
- You go first. - Okay.

959
00:35:37.481 --> 00:35:39.550
(Is he really going to take the top off?)

960
00:35:40.621 --> 00:35:42.450
(He's a real man.)

961
00:35:42.851 --> 00:35:44.791
- How are you going to do it? - No way.

962
00:35:45.021 --> 00:35:47.760
You're going to catch a cold. You really shouldn't.

963
00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:50.430
(Why not?)

964
00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:53.660
(Real men's match)

965
00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:56.630
It's real.

966
00:35:56.731 --> 00:35:57.840
Goodness.

967
00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:00.771
(Ice rubbing)

968
00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:03.311
(Energetic)

969
00:36:04.211 --> 00:36:05.280
(They cheer.)

970
00:36:06.081 --> 00:36:07.550
(Take this too.)

971
00:36:08.711 --> 00:36:10.921
Help me.

972
00:36:10.921 --> 00:36:11.921
(He's in a rush.)

973
00:36:12.021 --> 00:36:14.220
Get ready. Get ready now.

974
00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:16.021
They must be freezing.

975
00:36:16.021 --> 00:36:18.360
You need to be careful. You have to be really careful.

976
00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:19.921
- It's freezing. - Get ready.

977
00:36:19.921 --> 00:36:22.760
(Ichon-dong calves versus Mangwon Market President Yook)

978
00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:25.530
It's windy.

979
00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:27.061
- Get ready. - Hurry up.

980
00:36:27.061 --> 00:36:28.101
It's so cold.

981
00:36:28.101 --> 00:36:31.541
Get ready. Set. Go.

982
00:36:31.541 --> 00:36:32.541
(Joong Wan lifts Jeong Soo.)

983
00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:37.780
(Jeong Soo tries his best.)

984
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:40.851
(Relaxed)

985
00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:43.251
(Joong Wan's not pushed easily.)

986
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:44.981
(Then...)

987
00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:48.320
(It's the chicken feet attack.)

988
00:36:49.851 --> 00:36:51.820
(It's a shocking and horrifying match.)

989
00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:53.760
His butt's showing.

990
00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:56.231
(He's even using his buttocks muscles.)

991
00:36:57.561 --> 00:36:59.331
(He grabs the thighs.)

992
00:36:59.831 --> 00:37:01.970
- Jeong Soo's pushing him. - Be careful.

993
00:37:02.871 --> 00:37:05.441
(What's the result?)

994
00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:10.110
(Jeong Soo lost.)

995
00:37:10.541 --> 00:37:11.840
(He's stopping Jeong Soo from getting up.)

996
00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:15.311
(He runs quickly into the room.)

997
00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:22.151
(Jeong Soo cracks them up.)

998
00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:25.061
That was so funny.

999
00:37:25.061 --> 00:37:26.990
- It really was. - Jeong Soo...

1000
00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:28.630
didn't go home, did he?

1001
00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:30.430
Let's get in. It's cold.

1002
00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:32.331
- It was fun. - Gosh.

1003
00:37:32.461 --> 00:37:33.731
It was.

1004
00:37:33.731 --> 00:37:35.800
- It was a good game. - It was fun.

1005
00:37:36.871 --> 00:37:38.800
(The guys went to wash up.)

1006
00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:41.171
(How will Seong Woo wash his face?)

1007
00:37:42.171 --> 00:37:44.380
(The hot water and the cold water come out separately there.)

1008
00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:47.811
(He mixes one bowl of each.)

1009
00:37:47.811 --> 00:37:49.151
(Rubbing meticulously)

1010
00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:52.351
(Is it all spread well?)

1011
00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:55.651
(Rinsing thoroughly)

1012
00:37:56.891 --> 00:37:59.021
(Jae Hwan...)

1013
00:37:59.021 --> 00:38:02.360
(washes his face while squatting down.)

1014
00:38:03.231 --> 00:38:04.700
(Rubbing hard)

1015
00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:07.530
(He's not a man from the wild.)

1016
00:38:08.331 --> 00:38:10.430
(Daniel washes meticulously while looking in the mirror.)

1017
00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:15.211
(Puppy Daniel washes his face like a kitten.)

1018
00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:18.340
(He looks chic at the end.)

1019
00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:22.110
(Sighing)

1020
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:25.151
Gosh. My feet are freezing.

1021
00:38:26.421 --> 00:38:27.921
It was really fun today.

1022
00:38:29.251 --> 00:38:31.590
How did you find a place like this?

1023
00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:32.691
Sorry?

1024
00:38:32.691 --> 00:38:33.891
(It's hard to believe they're here.)

1025
00:38:33.891 --> 00:38:36.930
Well... They said in the introduction of this place...

1026
00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:39.860
that they decorated the school like a pension,

1027
00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:43.271
so I thought it would be nice to make good memories...

1028
00:38:43.901 --> 00:38:45.041
in an abandoned school.

1029
00:38:45.041 --> 00:38:47.200
(This could be called "The Unexpected Prison Playbook".)

1030
00:38:48.941 --> 00:38:50.780
Did you hear any scary stories while you were students?

1031
00:38:51.441 --> 00:38:54.050
I'm not sure if it's a scary story,

1032
00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:56.180
but it's a true story.

1033
00:38:56.311 --> 00:38:57.921
If it's a true story, it'll be fun.

1034
00:38:58.450 --> 00:38:59.851
Tell us the true story. Hurry.

1035
00:38:59.851 --> 00:39:01.320
- The true story? - Please.

1036
00:39:01.521 --> 00:39:03.450
It's a story I heard in the army.

1037
00:39:05.121 --> 00:39:08.860
(They're listening to a scary true story...)

1038
00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.590
(at an abandoned school late at night.)

1039
00:39:11.731 --> 00:39:13.160
There was a guy...

1040
00:39:13.961 --> 00:39:15.601
who always had gloomy eyes.

1041
00:39:16.401 --> 00:39:19.401
One day, he dreamed of going to a reservoir.

1042
00:39:20.671 --> 00:39:22.041
He said his deceased mother,

1043
00:39:23.441 --> 00:39:24.811
who was wearing a white hanbok,

1044
00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:27.410
was gradually approaching him from the water.

1045
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:31.320
He was so scared even though he knew it was his mother.

1046
00:39:32.481 --> 00:39:35.191
Because he couldn't see her face well...

1047
00:39:35.191 --> 00:39:38.621
as it was covered with her hair.

1048
00:39:38.621 --> 00:39:41.061
She was slowly immersing from the water and approaching him.

1049
00:39:41.791 --> 00:39:43.490
Then he said...

1050
00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:46.360
he finally saw her face.

1051
00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:49.871
But suddenly...

1052
00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:52.800
(They're screaming at the thump.)

1053
00:39:53.041 --> 00:39:54.570
(Startled)

1054
00:39:59.041 --> 00:40:00.240
(They're terrified.)

1055
00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.450
- What was that? - What the...

1056
00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:05.720
What on earth was that?

1057
00:40:06.581 --> 00:40:09.220
- My goodness. - I was so scared.

1058
00:40:09.751 --> 00:40:11.820
What's wrong with you?

1059
00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:14.490
What is the matter with you?

1060
00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:16.360
- I almost got a heart attack. - I was terrified.

1061
00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:17.961
I'm fully awake now.

1062
00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:20.300
Where were we?

1063
00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:21.771
That was truly unexpected.

1064
00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:23.671
I was frightened.

1065
00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:27.610
Let's eat something delicious tomorrow.

1066
00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:29.240
- Okay. - All right.

1067
00:40:30.211 --> 00:40:32.041
- Makguksu will be good. - I like every food.

1068
00:40:32.541 --> 00:40:34.880
(Let's go to Jeonju, Sung Kyu.)

1069
00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:37.211
(Why?)

1070
00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:40.021
(He thought Gyeong Gyu was joking.)

1071
00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:44.360
(Early in the morning at Yongsan Station)

1072
00:40:44.891 --> 00:40:48.490
(A KTX train is ready to depart.)

1073
00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:51.630
Let's go.

1074
00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:52.860
(Gyeong Gyu jokingly suggested they visit Sung Kyu's hometown,)

1075
00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:56.130
(and they're really going now.)

1076
00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:00.240
(Surprisingly, it was Sung Kyu who planned this trip.)

1077
00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:04.280
It was because Jeonju is my hometown.

1078
00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:06.110
I thought...

1079
00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:10.610
it would be nice to travel where I lived...

1080
00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:12.320
and spend time talking to each other,

1081
00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:15.220
so I can get closer to Gyeong Gyu.

1082
00:41:15.251 --> 00:41:16.720
That's why I planned this trip.

1083
00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:19.921
I went there to let him feel the peaceful atmosphere,

1084
00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:25.530
and help him get some rest in a comfortable setting, but...

1085
00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:28.371
(But he can't finish his sentence.)

1086
00:41:28.731 --> 00:41:30.570
(Something is likely to happen.)

1087
00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:33.871
Jeonju is the city of aristocrats.

1088
00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:35.510
Did you eat breakfast?

1089
00:41:36.141 --> 00:41:38.311
- No, not yet. - I bought burgers.

1090
00:41:38.941 --> 00:41:41.311
(Wow, did you prepare mine too?)

1091
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:42.880
You bought this for me, right?

1092
00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:44.351
No. I bought it for myself.

1093
00:41:44.351 --> 00:41:46.651
(No. I bought it for myself.)

1094
00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:49.851
I can care about others only after my stomach is full.

1095
00:41:49.851 --> 00:41:51.160
(Now, he understands.)

1096
00:41:51.421 --> 00:41:52.990
Here is a sandwich.

1097
00:41:53.891 --> 00:41:55.030
Coke.

1098
00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:57.461
- Thank you. - Coke.

1099
00:41:58.930 --> 00:42:00.501
You have a lot of Japanese fans,

1100
00:42:00.501 --> 00:42:01.771
- Yes. - right?

1101
00:42:01.930 --> 00:42:03.871
I released many albums in Japan.

1102
00:42:03.871 --> 00:42:07.171
(Taking a big bite)

1103
00:42:08.171 --> 00:42:10.211
- Did you study in Japan? - Yes.

1104
00:42:11.481 --> 00:42:13.941
I studied in Japan in the past.

1105
00:42:14.081 --> 00:42:16.450
(Hamburgers taste best when you eat it with your hands.)

1106
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:17.950
Why are you eating like that?

1107
00:42:18.921 --> 00:42:20.550
(What?)

1108
00:42:21.191 --> 00:42:22.950
It's my style.

1109
00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:24.691
(He gives some tissues.)

1110
00:42:24.691 --> 00:42:25.791
Burgers...

1111
00:42:26.061 --> 00:42:27.791
(Just wiping briefly)

1112
00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:30.590
(He seems to be bothered.)

1113
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:32.901
(But Gyeong Gyu doesn't care.)

1114
00:42:33.831 --> 00:42:36.130
(He just sticks to his style of eating.)

1115
00:42:36.601 --> 00:42:39.470
(This man has his own charm and makes people take care of him.)

1116
00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:43.240
- Why? - So that you won't choke.

1117
00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:44.610
I'm okay.

1118
00:42:45.311 --> 00:42:48.311
(Sung Kyu is good at taking care of Gyeong Gyu now.)

1119
00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:51.220
There is...

1120
00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:55.191
a place called Hyanggyo in Jeonju.

1121
00:42:55.351 --> 00:42:56.851
You're right.

1122
00:42:56.851 --> 00:43:01.231
It was an educational institution in the Joseon Dynasty.

1123
00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:03.090
You know about it very well.

1124
00:43:03.090 --> 00:43:05.001
So it's the city of aristocrats.

1125
00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:07.731
- Where are you from? - I'm from Busan.

1126
00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:09.731
- But you know a lot. - About what?

1127
00:43:09.731 --> 00:43:10.970
About Jeonju.

1128
00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:14.211
Lee Seong Gye, the first king of the dynasty,

1129
00:43:14.211 --> 00:43:16.141
is my ancestor.

1130
00:43:17.481 --> 00:43:19.510
- Did your family come from Jeonju? - Right.

1131
00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:21.311
So I'm very interested in Jeonju.

1132
00:43:22.410 --> 00:43:24.180
A descendant of the Lee family from Jeonju in what generation?

1133
00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:28.450
Well, I'm not a direct descendant of the Lee family from Jeonju.

1134
00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:31.291
There is Prince Hyoryeong...

1135
00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:33.921
and I'm a descendant of...

1136
00:43:34.930 --> 00:43:36.530
- Pardon? - Gosh.

1137
00:43:36.791 --> 00:43:38.700
I don't know it very well. Don't ask.

1138
00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:41.871
But I'm just a part of the Lee family originated from Jeonju.

1139
00:43:41.871 --> 00:43:44.700
So you're a part of that family...

1140
00:43:45.541 --> 00:43:46.671
(He needs to change subjects.)

1141
00:43:46.671 --> 00:43:48.740
It won't take long.

1142
00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:50.340
It takes about an hour and a half.

1143
00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:52.441
Jeonju is close if you take the KTX.

1144
00:43:53.110 --> 00:43:55.010
- You can get there quickly now. - What?

1145
00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:56.910
It used to take about three hours when I was young.

1146
00:43:56.910 --> 00:43:59.081
Three hours? Probably.

1147
00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:01.151
It takes only an hour and a half now.

1148
00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:05.561
Have you taken a train lately?

1149
00:44:05.561 --> 00:44:07.291
I take a train a lot.

1150
00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:09.360
You used to take a train a lot in the past, right?

1151
00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:12.160
That's right. And I take a train these days too.

1152
00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:15.130
Have you heard about Naeilro tickets for those in their 20s?

1153
00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:16.200
- What? - Naeilro.

1154
00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:17.371
- Naeilro? - Yes.

1155
00:44:17.441 --> 00:44:18.800
Naeilro...

1156
00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:21.070
It sounds like tomorrow in Korean.

1157
00:44:21.070 --> 00:44:22.771
Right. It does mean tomorrow.

1158
00:44:22.771 --> 00:44:24.610
- Naeilro. - If you buy that ticket,

1159
00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:26.510
you can take the train...

1160
00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:29.280
as many times as you want...

1161
00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:31.081
while traveling the country.

1162
00:44:31.151 --> 00:44:33.780
With that ticket, you can get discounts...

1163
00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:36.950
on your accommodations, paragliding,

1164
00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:40.090
riding rail bikes, and so on.

1165
00:44:40.090 --> 00:44:41.090
But for those in their 20s only.

1166
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:43.291
Oh, you can't use that.

1167
00:44:43.391 --> 00:44:44.630
(I forgot about your age.)

1168
00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:46.001
What kind of ticket is that?

1169
00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:49.331
I'm still in my 20s.

1170
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:50.941
You make the most of it then.

1171
00:44:50.941 --> 00:44:52.101
(He thought Gyeong Gyu was like his friend.)

1172
00:44:52.101 --> 00:44:53.401
I can use that ticket.

1173
00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:56.641
- This is nice. - We should sign this contract.

1174
00:44:57.271 --> 00:44:59.610
We have to sign it again somehow.

1175
00:45:02.211 --> 00:45:05.050
May I hear what you want?

1176
00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:06.751
"To go on a gourmet trip."

1177
00:45:06.751 --> 00:45:07.990
(The trip to Jeonju will meet Gyeong Gyu's criteria.)

1178
00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:09.621
"To get closer to each other."

1179
00:45:09.621 --> 00:45:12.191
- "To do what I want to do." - "To do what I want to do."

1180
00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:13.961
(That condition hasn't changed.)

1181
00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:15.530
- What are your conditions? - For me,

1182
00:45:15.691 --> 00:45:17.291
I would like to skip breakfast and sleep in.

1183
00:45:17.291 --> 00:45:18.530
(What?)

1184
00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:19.561
It won't do, right?

1185
00:45:19.561 --> 00:45:20.901
Breakfast... Well...

1186
00:45:22.231 --> 00:45:23.231
Can we?

1187
00:45:23.231 --> 00:45:24.641
Why would we skip breakfast?

1188
00:45:25.401 --> 00:45:27.470
Because we're tired.

1189
00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:31.410
- We can't sleep enough as it's... - Okay.

1190
00:45:31.711 --> 00:45:33.041
So you can do it for me.

1191
00:45:33.481 --> 00:45:35.610
Well... can't I eat breakfast alone?

1192
00:45:35.610 --> 00:45:37.180
- Pardon? - Can I eat while you're sleeping?

1193
00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:38.251
Should I not eat either?

1194
00:45:38.251 --> 00:45:39.780
How would you like if we sleep some more,

1195
00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:41.151
and have bigger lunch,

1196
00:45:41.151 --> 00:45:43.421
or have brunch together?

1197
00:45:43.421 --> 00:45:45.791
- Okay. - Good. And the second one.

1198
00:45:46.191 --> 00:45:48.490
Your chicken ramyeon was a great hit in the past.

1199
00:45:49.231 --> 00:45:51.461
So I'd like to make a new ramyeon recipe that will exceed...

1200
00:45:51.461 --> 00:45:53.601
the success of the chicken ramyeon together.

1201
00:45:53.601 --> 00:45:54.731
(I see.)

1202
00:45:54.731 --> 00:45:58.101
Then we may start a business together.

1203
00:45:59.501 --> 00:46:02.271
As I'm getting older...

1204
00:46:02.271 --> 00:46:03.711
Right. That is an important matter.

1205
00:46:03.711 --> 00:46:05.311
I want to get prepared for my future.

1206
00:46:05.311 --> 00:46:07.851
Fate brought us together,

1207
00:46:07.851 --> 00:46:10.280
it would be great to shoot a commercial with you too.

1208
00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:12.050
- And the third... - You want to make new ramyeon.

1209
00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:14.320
- Yes. Since you really like it. - Right.

1210
00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:15.990
- Shall we write it? - Sure.

1211
00:46:16.751 --> 00:46:18.521
(When they were writing the contract for the first time...)

1212
00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:20.860
(Wait. Please don't sign the contract yet.)

1213
00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:22.160
(Let me think about it some more.)

1214
00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:27.061
(Sung Kyu felt so uncomfortable about living with the old senior.)

1215
00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:28.570
Hey.

1216
00:46:28.831 --> 00:46:30.800
(But now, he is playing a very active role.)

1217
00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:35.070
(They finished signing the contract again quickly with Sung Kyu's lead.)

1218
00:46:35.671 --> 00:46:37.780
Jeonju is famous for bibimbap, right?

1219
00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:39.641
Yes. There are many good bibimbap restaurants.

1220
00:46:39.641 --> 00:46:41.081
- Right. - Would you like to eat it?

1221
00:46:41.081 --> 00:46:42.481
I'd love to.

1222
00:46:42.481 --> 00:46:45.121
I know a restaurant that sells good bibimbap.

1223
00:46:45.121 --> 00:46:46.251
- Do you? - Yes.

1224
00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:47.691
Bibimbap with seasoned raw beef.

1225
00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:49.090
That sounds great.

1226
00:46:49.421 --> 00:46:50.660
Thank you.

1227
00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:51.660
(It's a restaurant that a local recommends.)

1228
00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:53.720
(Proud)

1229
00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:56.061
Do you go there often?

1230
00:46:56.331 --> 00:47:00.771
I went there often with my family when I was young.

1231
00:47:02.271 --> 00:47:04.501
It's a place that reminds me of the times...

1232
00:47:04.501 --> 00:47:08.641
when I was eating there with my mom.

1233
00:47:09.771 --> 00:47:12.510
My parents still go there...

1234
00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:14.151
- to eat frequently. - Do they?

1235
00:47:14.151 --> 00:47:15.380
- The bibimbap place? - Yes.

1236
00:47:16.610 --> 00:47:19.380
(It's making him salivate.)

1237
00:47:19.450 --> 00:47:21.851
It's warmer than Seoul, right?

1238
00:47:22.191 --> 00:47:23.550
Yes. It's south of Seoul, you know.

1239
00:47:25.391 --> 00:47:27.291
(Their journey to the warm city in the south)

1240
00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:30.561
(But as their journey progresses,)

1241
00:47:32.001 --> 00:47:34.630
(it looks more like they're going on an Antarctic expedition.)

1242
00:47:35.901 --> 00:47:37.771
(Frozen)

1243
00:47:37.941 --> 00:47:40.171
- It's snowing a lot. - I know. It's snowing so much.

1244
00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:42.340
(What is going on?)

1245
00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:46.380
(Snow welcomes them.)

1246
00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:49.811
(They've arrived in Sung Kyu's hometown, Jeonju.)

1247
00:47:49.811 --> 00:47:51.320
The city with the most Korean charms.

1248
00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:52.680
That's right.

1249
00:47:53.651 --> 00:47:56.590
(We wonder what Sung Kyu was like as a kid.)

1250
00:47:56.590 --> 00:47:58.021
- Let's take a taxi. - Sure.

1251
00:47:59.621 --> 00:48:01.191
- Let's just take that one. - Okay.

1252
00:48:01.191 --> 00:48:02.590
(They take a taxi because of the snow.)

1253
00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:03.630
I'll hold the door for you.

1254
00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:06.630
Hello.

1255
00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:09.130
- Hello. - It's very nice to meet you.

1256
00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:11.401
You know the restaurant, right?

1257
00:48:11.401 --> 00:48:12.401
(Of course.)

1258
00:48:12.401 --> 00:48:14.141
It's a pretty big restaurant, right?

1259
00:48:14.141 --> 00:48:15.141
Yes, it is.

1260
00:48:17.581 --> 00:48:20.110
- Is it your friend? - No, an emergency text message.

1261
00:48:20.581 --> 00:48:22.880
A cold wave warning has been issued.

1262
00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:23.910
(Heavy snow expected until tomorrow)

1263
00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:26.220
(Gyeong Gyu is worried about the snow.)

1264
00:48:26.550 --> 00:48:28.021
Chonbuk National University is that way.

1265
00:48:28.121 --> 00:48:29.651
I see, Chonbuk National University.

1266
00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:32.921
The high school I went to is inside their campus.

1267
00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:35.090
I went to Chonbuk National University High School.

1268
00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:36.160
(He's back after a long time.)

1269
00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:38.200
- It hasn't changed at all. - What?

1270
00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.300
This area hasn't changed at all. It looked exactly like this...

1271
00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:41.331
even when I was a little kid.

1272
00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:43.570
There was a book store across the street,

1273
00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:45.041
but that's gone.

1274
00:48:45.041 --> 00:48:46.041
(There have been slight changes.)

1275
00:48:46.901 --> 00:48:48.340
Gosh, my dear General.

1276
00:48:49.441 --> 00:48:51.541
I was thinking about bringing my dogs, but...

1277
00:48:52.081 --> 00:48:54.110
- You should've brought them. - No.

1278
00:48:54.110 --> 00:48:55.610
I've learned my lesson.

1279
00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:58.651
They drool so much.

1280
00:48:58.651 --> 00:49:00.550
They literally drool nonstop.

1281
00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:01.990
I didn't see it.

1282
00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:03.950
Gosh, every morning...

1283
00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:04.990
(The dogs make him laugh.)

1284
00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:06.421
Every morning, there's poop everywhere.

1285
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:11.030
- I felt bad after watching it. - Gosh, don't worry about it.

1286
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:12.601
No, I was so surprised.

1287
00:49:12.601 --> 00:49:13.930
(After chatting for a while)

1288
00:49:14.070 --> 00:49:15.371
This is the restaurant.

1289
00:49:15.371 --> 00:49:16.630
- This is it? - Yes.

1290
00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:19.840
- Let's go. Oh, boy. - Oh, that way.

1291
00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:21.910
- Thank you. - Goodbye.

1292
00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:23.541
(They've already forgotten about the burgers.)

1293
00:49:23.541 --> 00:49:24.541
Oh, boy.

1294
00:49:25.641 --> 00:49:27.450
My gosh, this must be it. Let's go in.

1295
00:49:28.581 --> 00:49:31.780
(They enter the restaurant.)

1296
00:49:32.151 --> 00:49:34.651
Sung Kyu! You've been a regular here since you were a kid.

1297
00:49:34.651 --> 00:49:35.921
- That's right. - Good to see you.

1298
00:49:35.921 --> 00:49:36.950
Hello.

1299
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:38.461
- Hello. - Hello.

1300
00:49:38.461 --> 00:49:39.490
(They welcome them.)

1301
00:49:39.490 --> 00:49:40.561
Hello.

1302
00:49:44.061 --> 00:49:46.901
She must be the owner.

1303
00:49:46.901 --> 00:49:48.601
Yes, she's the owner.

1304
00:49:48.601 --> 00:49:50.470
Everyone at the restaurant knows you.

1305
00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:52.200
I've been coming here a lot for years.

1306
00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:53.441
(Since he was a kid)

1307
00:49:53.441 --> 00:49:54.910
Even the lady in the kitchen...

1308
00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:55.941
(He's been a regular.)

1309
00:49:55.941 --> 00:49:57.271
She recognized you right away.

1310
00:49:57.380 --> 00:49:58.441
My gosh.

1311
00:49:59.211 --> 00:50:01.180
You must know this area like the back of your hand.

1312
00:50:02.811 --> 00:50:04.280
(Proud)

1313
00:50:04.981 --> 00:50:06.550
Today, I'll just...

1314
00:50:07.621 --> 00:50:09.921
follow your lead.

1315
00:50:09.921 --> 00:50:11.490
Yes, I have the route mapped out in my head.

1316
00:50:11.791 --> 00:50:13.160
Let's eat first,

1317
00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:15.191
then reminisce my memories together.

1318
00:50:15.191 --> 00:50:16.461
- All right. - Just follow me.

1319
00:50:16.461 --> 00:50:17.530
Okay, sounds good.

1320
00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:21.831
If there's anything that you don't like,

1321
00:50:21.831 --> 00:50:23.871
you can just raise your left hand quietly...

1322
00:50:24.141 --> 00:50:25.740
- to let me know. - Gosh, it's...

1323
00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:27.101
I'll know that it's dangerous.

1324
00:50:27.101 --> 00:50:28.271
So far, so good.

1325
00:50:28.271 --> 00:50:30.070
- Are you enjoying it so far? - It's been very good.

1326
00:50:30.070 --> 00:50:32.740
I'm in such a good mood now. I'm really excited.

1327
00:50:32.910 --> 00:50:34.981
- You're happy now, right? - I'm very happy.

1328
00:50:35.010 --> 00:50:36.010
It's perfect now.

1329
00:50:36.010 --> 00:50:37.081
(He's in a great mood.)

1330
00:50:37.211 --> 00:50:39.720
The place where I got your autograph is right across the street.

1331
00:50:40.891 --> 00:50:43.291
(Back when Gyeong Gyu had a gimbap restaurant business,)

1332
00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:46.860
(he held a fan signing event in Jeonju,)

1333
00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:50.461
(and Sung Kyu got his autograph at that event.)

1334
00:50:50.461 --> 00:50:52.200
(You looked so grumpy that day.)

1335
00:50:52.561 --> 00:50:54.171
- It was right over there. - Really?

1336
00:50:54.171 --> 00:50:57.231
Yes. The gimbap place...

1337
00:50:57.231 --> 00:50:58.570
that was part of your franchise...

1338
00:50:58.570 --> 00:50:59.871
(Please forget about it already.)

1339
00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:03.470
- Hello. - Hello.

1340
00:51:04.541 --> 00:51:06.780
- I'm so honored to meet you. - It's nice to meet you.

1341
00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:07.811
It's my honor.

1342
00:51:07.811 --> 00:51:09.780
Sung Kyu is all grown up now.

1343
00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:11.280
I almost couldn't recognize him.

1344
00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:13.550
I haven't seen you since I was very young.

1345
00:51:13.550 --> 00:51:15.651
You've been coming to my restaurant since you were a little kid.

1346
00:51:15.921 --> 00:51:17.621
You were so adorable.

1347
00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:19.521
- Was he adorable? - Yes.

1348
00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:21.731
- He was such a great dancer. - Oh, my.

1349
00:51:21.731 --> 00:51:23.360
- He sang for us too. - He's a great singer.

1350
00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:25.260
He was very into singing.

1351
00:51:25.630 --> 00:51:27.871
- I wondered what he'd become. - When he grows up, right?

1352
00:51:27.871 --> 00:51:30.430
My gosh, you must've wondered if he'd grow up decently.

1353
00:51:31.371 --> 00:51:32.871
His parents are also...

1354
00:51:33.001 --> 00:51:35.410
- You're the owner, right? - Yes.

1355
00:51:35.410 --> 00:51:38.240
Then did you come up with the recipe for the bibimbap yourself?

1356
00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:40.380
Yes. I'm...

1357
00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:42.711
a bibimbap master and a living national treasure.

1358
00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:44.751
(She's a living national treasure.)

1359
00:51:44.751 --> 00:51:46.151
Oh, I see. My gosh.

1360
00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:48.320
Oh, I see. My gosh.

1361
00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:49.990
(Gyeong Gyu has become polite all of a sudden.)

1362
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:52.291
I saw that you're a holder of...

1363
00:51:52.291 --> 00:51:54.090
- Intangible cultural property. - That's right.

1364
00:51:54.090 --> 00:51:56.561
You've been making bibimbap for three generations, right?

1365
00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:58.901
(I'm bibimbap master.)

1366
00:51:58.901 --> 00:52:02.731
What makes Jeonju bibimbap special?

1367
00:52:02.731 --> 00:52:04.901
Do you put in any special ingredient?

1368
00:52:04.901 --> 00:52:06.800
We make rice with bone broth.

1369
00:52:06.970 --> 00:52:08.840
- I see. - Yes, that's right.

1370
00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:10.570
- You make rice with bone broth. - Bone broth...

1371
00:52:10.570 --> 00:52:14.050
As a kid, Sung Kyu didn't like eating rice made with bone broth.

1372
00:52:14.050 --> 00:52:15.280
- Really? - Yes.

1373
00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:16.280
I didn't like it?

1374
00:52:17.151 --> 00:52:19.320
- Sung Kyu didn't like bone broth. - He was so cute.

1375
00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:21.320
You must've adored him a lot. You still remember such details.

1376
00:52:21.490 --> 00:52:23.791
Is there anyone to whom you can pass down this restaurant?

1377
00:52:24.191 --> 00:52:26.820
My daughter. My granddaughter is also...

1378
00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:28.430
How old is your granddaughter?

1379
00:52:28.590 --> 00:52:30.260
- She's 24. - Sung Kyu.

1380
00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:33.860
(Sung Kyu, this is it.)

1381
00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:35.101
This is your chance.

1382
00:52:36.430 --> 00:52:37.840
You should inherit this restaurant.

1383
00:52:38.070 --> 00:52:40.300
Am I already considered a member of the family?

1384
00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:41.340
(They're painting a big picture.)

1385
00:52:42.271 --> 00:52:44.981
(Does that mean this restaurant is mine now?)

1386
00:52:45.610 --> 00:52:46.981
My daughter is here.

1387
00:52:47.041 --> 00:52:48.581
Oh, hello.

1388
00:52:48.581 --> 00:52:50.410
- She's your daughter? - Hello.

1389
00:52:50.410 --> 00:52:51.981
I thought it was your granddaughter. You must know Sung Kyu.

1390
00:52:51.981 --> 00:52:53.050
- Yes. - Hello.

1391
00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:55.151
- I've known him since he was a kid. - Pardon me?

1392
00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:57.860
- I've known him since he was a kid. - Yes, I heard.

1393
00:53:00.391 --> 00:53:01.891
How many side dishes are there?

1394
00:53:03.691 --> 00:53:06.401
(All sorts of side dishes are filling up the table.)

1395
00:53:07.771 --> 00:53:09.371
All right, let's eat.

1396
00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:11.700
When you mix bibimbap,

1397
00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:13.401
you should use your chopsticks.

1398
00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:16.671
- Why? - That's how you mix it.

1399
00:53:16.671 --> 00:53:18.081
It's easier with chopsticks.

1400
00:53:18.581 --> 00:53:19.840
You're right. It's easier.

1401
00:53:20.751 --> 00:53:22.351
(Mixing)

1402
00:53:22.981 --> 00:53:24.280
- Enjoy. - You too.

1403
00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:25.320
Thanks for the food.

1404
00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:27.820
(He takes a big spoonful...)

1405
00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:29.121
(and eats it.)

1406
00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:32.061
(After mixing with his chopsticks,)

1407
00:53:32.061 --> 00:53:33.691
(he takes it right into his mouth.)

1408
00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:39.101
- Does it taste okay? - Yes, it's very good.

1409
00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:42.331
- You're really enjoying it, right? - Of course.

1410
00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:43.970
When we were eating chicken,

1411
00:53:43.970 --> 00:53:45.771
you even enjoyed raw chicken,

1412
00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:48.271
- so I'm just not sure... - No, no.

1413
00:53:49.171 --> 00:53:52.380
(Gyeong Gyu made baeksuk for Sung Kyu.)

1414
00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:54.910
(I don't think the meat is cooked.)

1415
00:53:56.711 --> 00:54:00.550
(Gyeong Gyu ate undercooked chicken.)

1416
00:54:03.050 --> 00:54:04.121
It's delicious.

1417
00:54:04.121 --> 00:54:05.320
(I really mean it this time.)

1418
00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:08.260
You were obviously a good kid.

1419
00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:11.501
- Pardon? - Had you had a dark past,

1420
00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:13.860
you wouldn't have brought me here.

1421
00:54:14.331 --> 00:54:15.371
Yes, you're right.

1422
00:54:15.530 --> 00:54:17.130
I cannot take you to my hometown.

1423
00:54:18.171 --> 00:54:20.441
- Did you do bad things? - No, just because.

1424
00:54:20.441 --> 00:54:21.510
(Does he have a dark past?)

1425
00:54:22.711 --> 00:54:25.211
(His eyes suddenly well up with tears.)

1426
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:29.651
Are you crying now?

1427
00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:32.280
No, I'm not.

1428
00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:33.320
(No, I'm not crying.)

1429
00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:36.421
- It looks like you're crying. - No, I'm not. These days,

1430
00:54:36.691 --> 00:54:38.490
I spend 2 to 3 days a week out in the sea.

1431
00:54:39.691 --> 00:54:42.660
Then I eat at someone's place one day a week.

1432
00:54:42.930 --> 00:54:44.601
I also sleep at someone else's place one day a week.

1433
00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:48.070
It means that I only get to go home one day...

1434
00:54:48.070 --> 00:54:49.530
I can only go home 1 or 2 days a week.

1435
00:54:51.141 --> 00:54:52.441
Whose place do you sleep?

1436
00:54:52.441 --> 00:54:54.771
- Your place. - Oh, right. My place.

1437
00:54:55.041 --> 00:54:56.840
I thought we were like family. My feelings are hurt.

1438
00:54:59.010 --> 00:55:00.240
My second home.

1439
00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:01.311
(It's my second home.)

1440
00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:03.610
You have to meet a good housemate.

1441
00:55:03.610 --> 00:55:04.950
(He keeps trying to patch things up.)

1442
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:06.820
I got to enjoy this bibimbap thanks to my housemate.

1443
00:55:07.021 --> 00:55:08.851
I've learned that 80 percent of life...

1444
00:55:09.121 --> 00:55:10.421
is decided by whom you meet.

1445
00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:14.231
To me, meeting you means...

1446
00:55:14.231 --> 00:55:15.391
I know.

1447
00:55:15.461 --> 00:55:17.401
- You're very lucky. - Sorry?

1448
00:55:17.401 --> 00:55:20.501
You're very lucky to have met me like this.

1449
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:22.001
I'm truly lucky.

1450
00:55:22.001 --> 00:55:23.630
Yes, you're really lucky.

1451
00:55:24.570 --> 00:55:27.271
I don't think such luck will come to me ever again.

1452
00:55:29.671 --> 00:55:30.910
Have you been working on your music?

1453
00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:33.441
We finished recording our new album,

1454
00:55:33.941 --> 00:55:37.050
and I'll be in a musical with Ahn Jae Wook.

1455
00:55:37.050 --> 00:55:38.180
- Seriously? - Yes.

1456
00:55:38.550 --> 00:55:40.280
You should come watch it if your time allows.

1457
00:55:40.621 --> 00:55:42.291
- Will you really come? - Yes, I like musicals.

1458
00:55:42.291 --> 00:55:43.720
- Really? You like musicals? - Yes.

1459
00:55:44.021 --> 00:55:45.621
Do you like baseball by any chance?

1460
00:55:47.291 --> 00:55:48.990
- I like soccer. - Soccer?

1461
00:55:49.691 --> 00:55:51.660
I want to become a soccer player if I can be born again.

1462
00:55:51.961 --> 00:55:53.700
- You like soccer that much? - Yes, I'm serious.

1463
00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:56.800
From the 1994 World Cup in the US...

1464
00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:59.641
to the 2018 World Cup in Russia,

1465
00:56:00.171 --> 00:56:01.771
I've been participating in every single one.

1466
00:56:02.470 --> 00:56:03.970
- You've been participating? - No, I mean...

1467
00:56:03.970 --> 00:56:06.211
I've been going to every World Cup.

1468
00:56:06.541 --> 00:56:08.280
- You've watched every World Cup. - That's right.

1469
00:56:08.711 --> 00:56:10.651
I've watched every World Cup in person.

1470
00:56:11.251 --> 00:56:13.121
(I, Gyeong Gyu,)

1471
00:56:14.021 --> 00:56:16.490
(go everywhere for soccer.)

1472
00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:19.961
(Let's go to the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia!)

1473
00:56:20.521 --> 00:56:22.030
Even yesterday, I watched soccer all night.

1474
00:56:22.191 --> 00:56:23.831
- Last night? You watched that game? - Yes.

1475
00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:25.660
The team with Messi.

1476
00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:28.430
What's the league called? I can't remember the name.

1477
00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:29.530
The Spanish league.

1478
00:56:29.530 --> 00:56:30.840
What's the name of it?

1479
00:56:31.101 --> 00:56:32.470
Gosh, I'm drawing a blank.

1480
00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:34.470
The Primeira Liga.

1481
00:56:34.811 --> 00:56:36.510
Primeiga Liga?

1482
00:56:36.541 --> 00:56:40.081
- The Primeira Liga. - No, that's the British one.

1483
00:56:40.811 --> 00:56:42.880
- The name of the Spanish one. - Primeira.

1484
00:56:43.481 --> 00:56:44.621
The Primeira Liga?

1485
00:56:44.621 --> 00:56:45.720
(He doesn't believe Sung Kyu.)

1486
00:56:46.121 --> 00:56:47.280
It was a different name.

1487
00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:48.351
(He looks it up himself.)

1488
00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:51.621
(It is the Primeira Liga.)

1489
00:56:52.461 --> 00:56:55.090
Yes, it's that name.

1490
00:56:57.030 --> 00:56:58.630
(He wants to evade embarrassment.)

1491
00:56:58.961 --> 00:57:01.470
Gyeong Gyu, shall we get going now?

1492
00:57:01.470 --> 00:57:02.470
Yes, we should.

1493
00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:03.530
Where are we going anyway?

1494
00:57:03.530 --> 00:57:05.070
I thought about where to take you next,

1495
00:57:05.501 --> 00:57:07.101
and I think we should visit my high school.

1496
00:57:07.641 --> 00:57:09.340
- Your high school? - Yes, my high school.

1497
00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:10.470
Why do I have to go there?

1498
00:57:11.541 --> 00:57:13.240
Well, in a way...

1499
00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:14.610
Now we're shooting this, but we're already like family...

1500
00:57:14.610 --> 00:57:15.981
living in the same house.

1501
00:57:15.981 --> 00:57:17.651
Last time we met,

1502
00:57:17.751 --> 00:57:19.921
you did whatever you liked.

1503
00:57:21.121 --> 00:57:22.490
We went to the dog swimming pool.

1504
00:57:22.490 --> 00:57:23.550
(They went to the swimming pool for dogs as Gyeong Gyu wished.)

1505
00:57:24.490 --> 00:57:25.521
(Stop it.)

1506
00:57:25.521 --> 00:57:26.590
Goodness.

1507
00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:28.760
(He's feeling sorry.)

1508
00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:30.231
Which school did you go to? Jeonju High School?

1509
00:57:30.231 --> 00:57:31.901
I went to Chonbuk National University High School.

1510
00:57:32.061 --> 00:57:34.970
We can take a walk around the campus. It's a college.

1511
00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:37.541
You will like it there.

1512
00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:39.541
You have Chonbuk National University here in North Jeolla Province.

1513
00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:42.311
You also have Woosuk University.

1514
00:57:42.311 --> 00:57:43.510
- There's Wooseok. - There's also Wonkwang University.

1515
00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:44.641
Wonkwang University.

1516
00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:46.840
Wonkwang University is a Buddhist college.

1517
00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:49.010
- You know it. - I went to Dongguk University.

1518
00:57:50.921 --> 00:57:52.751
Is Dongguk following Won Buddhism?

1519
00:57:52.751 --> 00:57:54.950
No, it is a regular Buddhist college.

1520
00:57:55.990 --> 00:57:58.660
- Isn't Wongang Won Buddhist? - No, it's just regular Buddhist.

1521
00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:01.590
These days the Internet is so advanced that...

1522
00:58:01.590 --> 00:58:03.561
we have to state facts only.

1523
00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:05.331
I think it's Won Buddhist.

1524
00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:07.930
(He's fact-checking.)

1525
00:58:10.671 --> 00:58:11.671
(Goodness)

1526
00:58:12.371 --> 00:58:15.010
I'm sorry Wongang University follows Won Buddhism.

1527
00:58:15.541 --> 00:58:16.740
- It's Won Buddhist. - What?

1528
00:58:17.711 --> 00:58:18.910
(It was close for Gyeong Gyu to tell wrong information.)

1529
00:58:18.910 --> 00:58:20.211
This is how you play it?

1530
00:58:20.211 --> 00:58:21.550
I'm sorry. I forgot.

1531
00:58:22.151 --> 00:58:24.450
I thought they were based on the same Buddhism.

1532
00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:29.191
(It's dawn at the abandoned school pension.)

1533
00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:33.360
Wanna One, get up. Wanna One, get up!

1534
00:58:34.590 --> 00:58:37.501
(Yook Soo is already up.)

1535
00:58:38.461 --> 00:58:40.260
(Robot Ong is still asleep.)

1536
00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:46.441
(The world is still new to Puppy Niel.)

1537
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:50.110
(Jae Hwan looks like dumplings.)

1538
00:58:51.041 --> 00:58:54.151
(Yawning)

1539
00:58:55.410 --> 00:58:57.450
(Crossing the field full of snow)

1540
00:58:58.651 --> 00:59:01.050
(Seong Woo enters the shower booth.)

1541
00:59:02.220 --> 00:59:03.320
Gosh! It's so cold.

1542
00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:06.421
(Screams from cold)

1543
00:59:07.191 --> 00:59:09.291
(He welcomes the snow with bare feet.)

1544
00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:14.171
It's warm here. It's really warm.

1545
00:59:15.001 --> 00:59:16.130
It's warm!

1546
00:59:16.570 --> 00:59:18.871
(Scratching)

1547
00:59:19.541 --> 00:59:21.541
(He starts stretching after scratching his back.)

1548
00:59:22.711 --> 00:59:24.010
(Competition)

1549
00:59:25.180 --> 00:59:28.711
(Screaming louder and louder)

1550
00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:33.521
(Mysterious emergency rescue)

1551
00:59:35.291 --> 00:59:36.550
(They suddenly stopped screaming.)

1552
00:59:37.791 --> 00:59:40.521
(The peace came after realizing what they were doing.)

1553
00:59:41.530 --> 00:59:43.130
(Embarrassed)

1554
00:59:44.901 --> 00:59:46.731
Are we going out to play?

1555
00:59:46.831 --> 00:59:48.101
- Of course, we are. - Okay.

1556
00:59:48.371 --> 00:59:50.130
Didn't we play a lot yesterday?

1557
00:59:51.101 --> 00:59:52.470
(Embarrassed)

1558
00:59:53.171 --> 00:59:54.240
Isn't yesterday enough?

1559
00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:55.441
Yes, we've played a lot.

1560
00:59:57.010 --> 01:00:00.410
(Playing around as much as he can)

1561
01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:03.251
(On the way to Gapyeong)

1562
01:00:03.711 --> 01:00:06.680
(They picked snow sledding.)

1563
01:00:07.751 --> 01:00:09.651
(He's a national snow-sledder by heart.)

1564
01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:12.061
(He's so into it.)

1565
01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:15.660
(Singing along)

1566
01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:18.831
I think it has a pretty scene there at the snow sled site.

1567
01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.800
Photographs last forever.

1568
01:00:20.901 --> 01:00:22.001
Goodness.

1569
01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:23.771
Aren't you going to shorten the strings?

1570
01:00:24.041 --> 01:00:26.200
(He wears it like a gold medal.)

1571
01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:28.610
Okay.

1572
01:00:30.141 --> 01:00:31.441
It's good.

1573
01:00:32.541 --> 01:00:35.450
(He's excited to take a lot of photographs.)

1574
01:00:35.711 --> 01:00:39.621
Seong Woo, how should I pose?

1575
01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:41.220
Should I pose in a coy manner?

1576
01:00:41.691 --> 01:00:43.351
(Shooting)

1577
01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:45.791
Could you make my legs look long?

1578
01:00:45.791 --> 01:00:47.121
Your legs?

1579
01:00:47.930 --> 01:00:49.231
(He got it.)

1580
01:00:50.191 --> 01:00:52.800
(Photographer Ong is doing his best to shoot well.)

1581
01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:53.860
It's nice.

1582
01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:55.901
This is like a giant.

1583
01:00:55.901 --> 01:00:57.641
My proportion is like a model's.

1584
01:00:57.941 --> 01:00:59.700
Let's get in!

1585
01:01:00.441 --> 01:01:01.510
Get in the car.

1586
01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:03.441
- Move in? - No, get in.

1587
01:01:03.970 --> 01:01:05.041
Get in.

1588
01:01:05.141 --> 01:01:08.680
(Everyone gets into the car.)

1589
01:01:10.351 --> 01:01:12.550
(Joong Wan is the only one who's not in the car.)

1590
01:01:14.450 --> 01:01:15.521
Why isn't he getting in?

1591
01:01:16.351 --> 01:01:18.320
- What are you doing? - What?

1592
01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:19.820
You should sit in front.

1593
01:01:20.061 --> 01:01:21.630
- What did you say? - You should sit in front.

1594
01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:24.760
- Why should I? - We played games last night.

1595
01:01:25.061 --> 01:01:27.601
You have to do as I wish.

1596
01:01:27.601 --> 01:01:28.630
(Wrestling loser is in panic.)

1597
01:01:29.070 --> 01:01:32.171
(The loser must grant everyone's wish.)

1598
01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:34.271
- Right. - He's right.

1599
01:01:34.271 --> 01:01:36.311
You have to do as I wish. You should drive now.

1600
01:01:36.311 --> 01:01:38.010
I wouldn't ask for mean things because it's a new year.

1601
01:01:38.010 --> 01:01:39.180
(He keeps his promises.)

1602
01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:40.240
He's Manager Yoon.

1603
01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:41.251
(He came in last.)

1604
01:01:41.450 --> 01:01:44.220
- Nice! - Thank you, Manager Yoon.

1605
01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:45.550
Please drive safely.

1606
01:01:45.550 --> 01:01:47.351
- Okay, let's get it. - Let's get it.

1607
01:01:47.791 --> 01:01:50.291
(He's happy to complete 1 wish.)

1608
01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:53.121
There's this restaurant that sells spicy catfish soup.

1609
01:01:54.961 --> 01:01:56.891
- They're probably boiling it now. - Goodness.

1610
01:01:58.061 --> 01:02:00.331
- It sounds delicious. - They have outdoor tables.

1611
01:02:01.030 --> 01:02:02.731
(That sounds delicious.)

1612
01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:05.371
(There's another restaurant.)

1613
01:02:05.371 --> 01:02:07.711
There's a dried yellow corvina set.

1614
01:02:09.010 --> 01:02:11.910
You have to have it with rice that's been put in water.

1615
01:02:13.141 --> 01:02:14.211
It sounds delicious.

1616
01:02:14.450 --> 01:02:15.581
There is budae jjigae.

1617
01:02:16.550 --> 01:02:17.780
I want to eat a steamed bun.

1618
01:02:18.151 --> 01:02:20.081
I want to have a steamed bun with banana milk.

1619
01:02:20.691 --> 01:02:22.550
I want a fish cake bar.

1620
01:02:22.550 --> 01:02:24.360
I want a fish cake bar and a steamed bun.

1621
01:02:25.021 --> 01:02:26.561
Don't they sell steamed buns in the convenience stores?

1622
01:02:26.561 --> 01:02:27.691
- I think they sell them. - Yes, they have.

1623
01:02:28.291 --> 01:02:31.030
(He hopes that a convenience store appears.)

1624
01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:32.760
(Finally, there's a convenience store)

1625
01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:34.331
Are you using your wish now?

1626
01:02:34.430 --> 01:02:35.501
Make a wish now.

1627
01:02:36.130 --> 01:02:37.200
I'll buy a lot.

1628
01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:39.401
(He gets out of the car to buy steamed buns.)

1629
01:02:40.441 --> 01:02:42.371
(He can't stop smiling.)

1630
01:02:43.541 --> 01:02:46.141
This has all the things I love. Seaweed and beef jerky.

1631
01:02:46.141 --> 01:02:47.240
It can't be true.

1632
01:02:47.351 --> 01:02:48.481
I must buy this.

1633
01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:50.981
(Daniel loses his mind in the convenience store.)

1634
01:02:50.981 --> 01:02:52.621
There's steamed bun.

1635
01:02:52.921 --> 01:02:56.050
Are you trying to buy this place out?

1636
01:02:56.050 --> 01:02:57.191
I'll have one more of this.

1637
01:02:57.191 --> 01:02:58.421
I really love this.

1638
01:03:01.630 --> 01:03:03.160
(He grabs the two full bags,)

1639
01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:04.360
(and they leave.)

1640
01:03:04.930 --> 01:03:06.101
Give me a bite.

1641
01:03:07.470 --> 01:03:08.601
This tastes so good.

1642
01:03:10.871 --> 01:03:12.101
(Regular people eat slowly.)

1643
01:03:12.101 --> 01:03:13.300
It's delicious.

1644
01:03:13.501 --> 01:03:14.641
I was starving.

1645
01:03:16.610 --> 01:03:18.340
(Just looking at it makes him happy.)

1646
01:03:18.610 --> 01:03:19.880
Please give me one too.

1647
01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:21.110
(He eats it like it's the last one.)

1648
01:03:22.110 --> 01:03:25.151
(He eats the whole thing in three bites.)

1649
01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:26.880
(Stabbing the straw)

1650
01:03:27.691 --> 01:03:29.121
(He drinks the banana milk in one sip.)

1651
01:03:29.391 --> 01:03:30.550
(He's determined.)

1652
01:03:31.421 --> 01:03:34.930
(He doesn't stop eating. He's the new boss of eating.)

1653
01:03:36.331 --> 01:03:38.461
(There's no turning back in his eating show.)

1654
01:03:40.231 --> 01:03:43.030
The scenery is beautiful.

1655
01:03:43.331 --> 01:03:44.740
The winter scenery is nice.

1656
01:03:46.501 --> 01:03:48.041
- I see the snow sled site. - Me too.

1657
01:03:48.041 --> 01:03:49.711
- Are you ready to enjoy? - Yes, we are.

1658
01:03:49.711 --> 01:03:51.481
- Are you ready? - Yes, we are!

1659
01:03:52.010 --> 01:03:54.251
(Everyone who has played knows this.)

1660
01:03:54.251 --> 01:03:55.510
(Snow sled sites are the hot place.)

1661
01:03:56.110 --> 01:03:57.880
(Mommy, it's exciting!)

1662
01:03:58.621 --> 01:04:00.220
(The race on snow...)

1663
01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:02.050
(makes people forget about the coldness.)

1664
01:04:02.490 --> 01:04:03.921
Your face is brighter.

1665
01:04:03.921 --> 01:04:05.621
- Your face looks better. - Yes, I'm very excited.

1666
01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:09.691
I've always wanted to go to a snow sled place.

1667
01:04:10.061 --> 01:04:12.700
Just hearing about it makes my heart beat fast.

1668
01:04:13.001 --> 01:04:14.101
It was superb.

1669
01:04:14.570 --> 01:04:16.001
Stand here. I'll take photos for you all.

1670
01:04:16.231 --> 01:04:18.401
- Sure. - Stand against this background.

1671
01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:20.371
1, 2, 3.

1672
01:04:22.271 --> 01:04:25.041
(They're excited to play.)

1673
01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:27.910
(This time everyone is in the photo.)

1674
01:04:29.110 --> 01:04:32.121
(We're the Ong Niel Hwan Yook Soo.)

1675
01:04:33.351 --> 01:04:35.450
- It looks fun. - This is the beginner's course.

1676
01:04:35.450 --> 01:04:36.550
Yes, there are different courses.

1677
01:04:36.550 --> 01:04:38.961
This is beginner's here. That's for intermediate's there.

1678
01:04:38.961 --> 01:04:40.220
Oh, really?

1679
01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:42.191
Let's warm up there.

1680
01:04:42.191 --> 01:04:43.831
- Let's do it here. - Sounds good.

1681
01:04:43.831 --> 01:04:46.831
Is this place for kids who are 4 or 5?

1682
01:04:46.930 --> 01:04:48.101
Let's warm up there.

1683
01:04:48.101 --> 01:04:49.831
- Let's go to the kid's place. - Okay.

1684
01:04:49.831 --> 01:04:53.641
I can sled standing up.

1685
01:04:54.570 --> 01:04:56.141
(Ong is bluffing.)

1686
01:04:56.141 --> 01:04:58.610
I've been to snow sleds before where there is no moving walks.

1687
01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:01.081
I had to run back then.

1688
01:05:01.081 --> 01:05:02.481
Yes, we used to run a lot.

1689
01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:04.820
I've never walked properly.

1690
01:05:05.151 --> 01:05:06.380
Seong Woo is excited.

1691
01:05:07.621 --> 01:05:09.090
I'm scared, though. What should I do?

1692
01:05:10.251 --> 01:05:12.191
Gosh, it's scary.

1693
01:05:12.990 --> 01:05:14.130
It's really scary.

1694
01:05:15.291 --> 01:05:16.391
I'm excited.

1695
01:05:17.930 --> 01:05:19.061
Hold on a second.

1696
01:05:19.530 --> 01:05:21.570
- Let me prepare myself. - Isn't this a competition?

1697
01:05:21.570 --> 01:05:23.601
- I'm sorry, but I'm scared. - Why is this making me nervous?

1698
01:05:23.601 --> 01:05:24.671
It's scary.

1699
01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:26.340
- Are you all ready to enjoy? - Yes!

1700
01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:27.641
- Ready. - Let's go.

1701
01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:28.840
Go!

1702
01:05:29.041 --> 01:05:30.470
(Let's go.)

1703
01:05:31.541 --> 01:05:34.550
(They all begin to race each other as if it were planned.)

1704
01:05:35.711 --> 01:05:37.211
(Someone is enjoying the fun of speed.)

1705
01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:40.021
(Someone is at the top of his lungs.)

1706
01:05:40.581 --> 01:05:42.791
(Someone couldn't wear his gloves.)

1707
01:05:43.021 --> 01:05:44.720
What shall I do? Hold on!

1708
01:05:46.090 --> 01:05:48.961
I can sled standing up.

1709
01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:51.231
This is too fast!

1710
01:05:52.930 --> 01:05:54.671
(Is this speed for real?)

1711
01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:58.501
(Joong Wan is sledding without hesitation.)

1712
01:06:00.671 --> 01:06:02.311
Hey, this is amazing!

1713
01:06:03.311 --> 01:06:05.410
(These two have just started.)

1714
01:06:06.441 --> 01:06:08.050
(Screaming like a crow)

1715
01:06:08.550 --> 01:06:09.811
(Somebody save Jae Hwan!)

1716
01:06:10.921 --> 01:06:12.021
(He pushes Jeong Soo.)

1717
01:06:12.021 --> 01:06:14.251
(Screaming)

1718
01:06:21.391 --> 01:06:23.490
(There is 1 crow, and 1 silent trainee.)

1719
01:06:24.901 --> 01:06:27.371
(Don't look down on 4 to 5 year olds from now on.)

1720
01:06:28.401 --> 01:06:29.570
It's fun. It's fun.

1721
01:06:30.070 --> 01:06:31.300
This wasn't too fast.

1722
01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:32.771
- This is fun. - It wasn't fast.

1723
01:06:32.771 --> 01:06:33.871
Wasn't I the first one to get down?

1724
01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:36.570
(It's not! It's not fast!)

1725
01:06:36.570 --> 01:06:37.610
This is just a warm up.

1726
01:06:37.610 --> 01:06:39.981
- You're good. - Shall we make bet?

1727
01:06:39.981 --> 01:06:42.151
- Let's go for three rounds. - Let's bet on something.

1728
01:06:42.251 --> 01:06:43.311
Yes.

1729
01:06:43.410 --> 01:06:45.121
Shall we move to the next one?

1730
01:06:45.121 --> 01:06:46.421
We're just starting.

1731
01:06:46.621 --> 01:06:47.990
The loser has to take off his shirt.

1732
01:06:48.151 --> 01:06:49.421
How about wrestling with the safety guard?

1733
01:06:49.521 --> 01:06:51.320
No, there are many children here.

1734
01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:52.561
Somebody will report us.

1735
01:06:52.561 --> 01:06:53.561
(What's the punishment?)

1736
01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:56.130
(As per everyone's wish)

1737
01:06:56.130 --> 01:06:57.700
(Jae Hwan's voice got louder.)

1738
01:06:58.030 --> 01:07:00.260
(It's a big mess.)

1739
01:07:01.030 --> 01:07:04.240
(Daniel is obsessed with taking good photographs.)

1740
01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:07.171
(He can't give up on taking good photographs.)

1741
01:07:07.941 --> 01:07:09.740
(Stir-fried chicken with cheese that looks like hand-pulled noodles)

1742

(The duo's new eating show)

1743
01:07:11.780 --> 01:07:13.280
(Having the food slowly)

1744
01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:16.651
(The 3 friends' tour goes on.)

1745
01:07:17.211 --> 01:07:19.251
(They give 5 stars.)

1746
01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:20.820
(But their teeth ache,)

1747
01:07:20.820 --> 01:07:22.720
(and their gum bleeds.)

1748
01:07:23.421 --> 01:07:24.760
(They still want the best photo.)

1749
01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:26.320
(Bae Yong Joon?)

1750
01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:27.791
(No, he looks like the Grim Reaper.)

1751
01:07:28.231 --> 01:07:29.831
(They can't take their eyes off Sapporo's night view.)

1752
01:07:29.831 --> 01:07:32.061
(In the spirit of the new year, they get serious...)

1753
01:07:32.561 --> 01:07:34.671
(and have a candid conversation.)

1754
01:07:35.430 --> 01:07:37.700
(And these guys visit Sung Kyu's high school!)

1755

(Will Gyeong Gyu surprise Sung Kyu...)

1758
01:07:46.010 --> 01:07:48.110
(with an unexpected confession?)

1759
01:07:48.651 --> 01:07:50.410
Are we in Siberia or something? What is this?

1760
01:07:50.410 --> 01:07:52.751
