1
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.951
I have two fathers.

2
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:10.920
Vice President Jang Soo Man.

3
00:00:11.051 --> 00:00:14.291
And someone else I don't know of. My real father.

4
00:00:15.521 --> 00:00:16.520
My biological father.

5
00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:18.660
You don't have...

6
00:00:19.191 --> 00:00:22.031
any father other than Vice President Jang Soo Man.

7
00:00:22.191 --> 00:00:24.360
For the past five years since I found out that...

8
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.761
I'm not the son of the Jangs,

9
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.640
I've never talked about it with you.

10
00:00:33.711 --> 00:00:35.310
(Episode 21)

11
00:01:16.551 --> 00:01:17.850
Jang Eun Cheon is...

12
00:01:19.721 --> 00:01:20.891
alive.

13
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.391
In fact,

14
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.361
he is...

15
00:01:26.721 --> 00:01:27.831
very...

16
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.130
very...

17
00:01:32.031 --> 00:01:33.460
close to you.

18
00:01:36.031 --> 00:01:37.501
What do you mean?

19
00:01:38.201 --> 00:01:39.270
The one...

20
00:01:41.341 --> 00:01:43.740
standing...

21
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.051
right in front of you...

22
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.891
I am Jang Soo Man's oldest son,

23
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.041
Jang Eun Cheon.

24
00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.551
Pil Joo.

25
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.391
That's not funny.

26
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.261
I laughed not to embarrass you.

27
00:03:38.891 --> 00:03:40.161
You could've...

28
00:03:41.231 --> 00:03:42.661
let us leave...

29
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.161
after bowing at Father's funeral.

30
00:03:50.301 --> 00:03:51.900
Did you have to kill us?

31
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.090
That's all...

32
00:04:13.891 --> 00:04:15.231
your mother's fault.

33
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:17.760
If your mother...

34
00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.060
took you...

35
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.801
to somewhere unknown to anyone, nothing would've happened.

36
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.971
How dare she...

37
00:04:28.211 --> 00:04:30.440
bring her two sons there in suits?

38
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.310
I...

39
00:04:34.911 --> 00:04:35.950
didn't want to...

40
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.250
live under the same sky sharing the air.

41
00:04:41.591 --> 00:04:42.721
For me to survive.

42
00:04:43.221 --> 00:04:44.690
I had to survive.

43
00:04:48.161 --> 00:04:49.930
I ordered Secretary Oh.

44
00:04:51.661 --> 00:04:52.700
First,

45
00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.401
dump the youngest who can't swim into water.

46
00:04:57.841 --> 00:04:58.841
Then...

47
00:04:59.541 --> 00:05:02.041
Eun Cheon who loves his mom and brother so much...

48
00:05:02.971 --> 00:05:04.341
will...

49
00:05:06.541 --> 00:05:08.580
jump into the water himself.

50
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.151
How did you survive?

51
00:05:18.221 --> 00:05:19.620
You're such a coward...

52
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.161
who abandoned your brother to save your own life.

53
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.570
Are you going to kill me?

54
00:05:44.721 --> 00:05:45.880
Jung Mal Ran.

55
00:05:47.721 --> 00:05:49.320
If you're scared, say you're scared.

56
00:05:50.461 --> 00:05:52.461
If you want to live, say you want to live.

57
00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.890
Beg me and be desperate.

58
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.471
I'm Kang Pil Joo.

59
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.471
I know...

60
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.140
everything about you...

61
00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.771
from head to toe.

62
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.260
Don't act...

63
00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.130
calm.

64
00:06:32.901 --> 00:06:34.271
That's disgusting.

65
00:07:20.851 --> 00:07:23.051
It wouldn't be fun...

66
00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:25.250
if the reason...

67
00:07:26.421 --> 00:07:28.421
I let you stay alive until now...

68
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.091
was to kill you with my hands.

69
00:07:34.861 --> 00:07:36.130
It's for you to experience...

70
00:07:44.841 --> 00:07:45.841
what my brother,

71
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:49.041
my mom, and I...

72
00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:51.810
went through in the water.

73
00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.521
My brother who barely grabbed my hand...

74
00:08:00.921 --> 00:08:02.291
drowned...

75
00:08:03.151 --> 00:08:04.190
because...

76
00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:07.390
he couldn't breathe...

77
00:08:09.361 --> 00:08:12.161
and had no strength to grab onto my hand.

78
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:16.401
And I was running out of breath,

79
00:08:18.301 --> 00:08:20.200
so I got out of the water...

80
00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:25.981
to breathe...

81
00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.010
like a coward...

82
00:08:29.551 --> 00:08:31.151
just like you said...

83
00:08:32.751 --> 00:08:34.690
even though his brother was drowning.

84
00:08:41.391 --> 00:08:43.031
Just like what you just experienced.

85
00:08:45.631 --> 00:08:48.171
Suffocating.

86
00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:08.590
I'll give you a chance.

87
00:09:10.051 --> 00:09:12.991
Bring Jang Boo Cheon off from the chairman position.

88
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.860
Announce that...

89
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:18.531
he's not capable of...

90
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.801
leading Cheong A's future.

91
00:09:24.541 --> 00:09:25.801
Then leave with him.

92
00:09:28.541 --> 00:09:29.940
Why do I have to do that?

93
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.041
Or...

94
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:34.850
you will have to...

95
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:37.980
spend the rest of your life in prison.

96
00:09:43.021 --> 00:09:44.291
Pil Joo.

97
00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:48.730
The statute of limitations on your brother's death...

98
00:09:50.161 --> 00:09:51.730
has expired.

99
00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.631
I will not...

100
00:09:57.801 --> 00:10:00.871
bring Boo Cheon down with my own hands.

101
00:10:02.241 --> 00:10:03.241
I can't...

102
00:10:05.041 --> 00:10:07.511
go to prison because the statute of limitations has expired.

103
00:10:14.551 --> 00:10:15.551
If...

104
00:10:18.021 --> 00:10:19.590
you're not going to kill me now,

105
00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:22.891
I'll leave.

106
00:10:30.671 --> 00:10:33.570
If you have anything else, come find me.

107
00:10:37.541 --> 00:10:40.080
Then how about this?

108
00:10:41.751 --> 00:10:42.950
Poisoning...

109
00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:46.820
Oh Ki Pyung.

110
00:10:53.891 --> 00:10:56.291
Do you have evidence?

111
00:10:56.661 --> 00:10:58.661
The fake will that you wrote.

112
00:11:00.301 --> 00:11:01.330
Also,

113
00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:05.570
In case Secretary Oh didn't drink the poison,

114
00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:08.440
a skilled assassin was hired as well.

115
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:11.340
The real owner of the borrowed account...

116
00:11:12.041 --> 00:11:13.911
from which the money was wired to the assassin.

117
00:11:14.751 --> 00:11:15.781
Of course,

118
00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.480
it must've been laundered a couple of times,

119
00:11:20.751 --> 00:11:23.350
but finding it out is a piece of cake for me.

120
00:11:25.991 --> 00:11:27.161
The heaviest penalty...

121
00:11:29.661 --> 00:11:31.001
for murder is capital punishment.

122
00:11:41.041 --> 00:11:42.070
I am not...

123
00:11:43.741 --> 00:11:44.940
going to jail.

124
00:11:46.641 --> 00:11:47.850
I won't.

125
00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.621
I don't like...

126
00:11:55.891 --> 00:11:57.021
that somber prison uniform.

127
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:02.131
I can never wear such clothes.

128
00:12:11.901 --> 00:12:13.440
Boo Cheon will step down...

129
00:12:14.041 --> 00:12:15.771
from the chairman post anyway,

130
00:12:16.371 --> 00:12:18.310
because I'll make him do so.

131
00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:21.651
I gave you a chance to expiate your sins.

132
00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:24.621
But if you don't want it, fine.

133
00:12:27.651 --> 00:12:29.291
You'll be put in prison as well.

134
00:12:30.521 --> 00:12:31.521
Prison uniform...

135
00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.391
Since you can't stay naked there,

136
00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:37.730
you'll have to wear it after all.

137
00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:40.871
Let's see...

138
00:12:41.631 --> 00:12:43.131
if things will go as you said.

139
00:12:52.881 --> 00:12:54.151
Ms. Jung Mal Ran.

140
00:13:06.121 --> 00:13:07.531
I'm warning you.

141
00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.531
Do not get on my nerves.

142
00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:13.330
If you do...

143
00:13:18.141 --> 00:13:19.271
"Boo Cheon,"

144
00:13:20.741 --> 00:13:21.741
"actually,"

145
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:24.541
"your biological father is..."

146
00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:29.551
"Oh Ki Pyung."

147
00:13:31.281 --> 00:13:32.651
This is what I'll tell him.

148
00:13:33.421 --> 00:13:35.021
What Jung Mal Ran...

149
00:13:35.551 --> 00:13:36.751
wants to erase...

150
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:39.820
and regrets the most...

151
00:13:40.391 --> 00:13:41.491
in her life...

152
00:13:42.631 --> 00:13:45.261
is the fact that she gave birth to Boo Cheon...

153
00:13:46.401 --> 00:13:47.801
with Oh Ki Pyung.

154
00:13:49.131 --> 00:13:50.271
The worst fear...

155
00:13:50.871 --> 00:13:52.840
of Jung Mal Ran is...

156
00:13:53.371 --> 00:13:55.070
that it becomes known...

157
00:13:56.011 --> 00:13:57.141
to others.

158
00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:04.621
Boo Cheon's father...

159
00:14:05.521 --> 00:14:08.051
desperately wanted to attend his son's wedding.

160
00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.771
On the night when he made a fuss about finding Jang Eun Cheon,

161
00:14:22.801 --> 00:14:24.541
Secretary Oh was with me.

162
00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:26.070
I told him...

163
00:14:27.011 --> 00:14:28.610
to find Eun Cheon...

164
00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:31.210
as soon as possible...

165
00:14:31.641 --> 00:14:33.041
and bring him to Mal Ran.

166
00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:35.610
Then...

167
00:14:37.051 --> 00:14:38.151
does that mean...

168
00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:42.121
Secretary Oh knew...

169
00:14:43.051 --> 00:14:44.621
that you are Eun Cheon?

170
00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.430
Then why...

171
00:14:53.531 --> 00:14:55.301
Did you also threaten Secretary Oh...

172
00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:58.100
that you'd tell Boo Cheon...

173
00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:01.641
who his biological father is?

174
00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:12.121
That's why he couldn't tell me.

175
00:15:17.661 --> 00:15:18.891
Darn it.

176
00:15:49.751 --> 00:15:50.761
I will...

177
00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:54.560
persuade Boo Cheon...

178
00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.700
once he calms himself down...

179
00:16:02.901 --> 00:16:04.200
as he's excited...

180
00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.871
to have just become the chairman.

181
00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:15.210
So...

182
00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:18.151
please forget...

183
00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.751
about Oh Ki Pyung.

184
00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.391
I'm begging you.

185
00:16:35.501 --> 00:16:36.570
Executive Jung.

186
00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.271
I'll give you three days.

187
00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.320
Come up with a plan...

188
00:16:57.991 --> 00:16:59.121
to drag Boo Cheon down.

189
00:17:10.201 --> 00:17:13.241
(Mooshimwon)

190
00:17:19.481 --> 00:17:20.580
This is unbelievable.

191
00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:23.820
How dare you tell me to come and go?

192
00:17:26.781 --> 00:17:28.850
I'm not asking you for obedience.

193
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:31.390
At least treat me like the chairman.

194
00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:30.281
What's gotten into you?

195
00:18:53.501 --> 00:18:54.741
Leave.

196
00:18:56.771 --> 00:18:58.981
You're really ordering me to come and go now.

197
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:02.110
Hey,

198
00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.781
it's you who asked me to come to see you.

199
00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:11.120
Are you telling me to leave...

200
00:19:12.491 --> 00:19:13.620
after such long silence?

201
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:16.431
I saw you,

202
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:18.660
so...

203
00:19:19.961 --> 00:19:21.001
just leave.

204
00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:24.701
You psycho.

205
00:19:34.751 --> 00:19:35.781
Hey,

206
00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.320
don't look at me like that. It really irritates me.

207
00:20:08.281 --> 00:20:09.410
Go.

208
00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:16.791
Come into my room.

209
00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:35.070
Did something bad happen?

210
00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:38.041
You look unwell.

211
00:20:40.451 --> 00:20:41.711
Kang Pil Joo...

212
00:20:43.281 --> 00:20:46.521
is Jang Eun Cheon, your half-brother...

213
00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:49.120
who we've believed to be dead.

214
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.560
How did you know that?

215
00:20:55.231 --> 00:20:56.261
Did...

216
00:20:56.761 --> 00:20:57.860
Pil Joo...

217
00:21:02.971 --> 00:21:05.570
Did you already know?

218
00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:08.570
Yes, Mom.

219
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:11.880
I can't believe you two.

220
00:21:12.681 --> 00:21:15.251
- Why didn't you tell me? - I didn't for your sake.

221
00:21:15.711 --> 00:21:17.951
I was worried that you might pass away because of the shock.

222
00:21:19.051 --> 00:21:23.191
You thought I'd die because of something like that?

223
00:21:23.191 --> 00:21:25.560
I know how much Pil Joo meant to you.

224
00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.660
Kang Pil Joo was a dog I used to raise.

225
00:21:28.961 --> 00:21:30.501
What kind of an owner...

226
00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:33.461
would die because the dog's name has changed?

227
00:21:34.201 --> 00:21:35.701
At least try to make sense of it.

228
00:21:38.471 --> 00:21:39.471
Mom.

229
00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:41.971
Anyway,

230
00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:44.310
that dog...

231
00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:47.880
is barking because he carries the lineage of his owner.

232
00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.721
We can't just ignore this case.

233
00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:57.860
Pil Joo.

234
00:21:59.261 --> 00:22:00.491
How will you handle him?

235
00:22:02.791 --> 00:22:04.060
I must eliminate him.

236
00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:07.070
I will decide when to throw him out.

237
00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.701
Leave it to me.

238
00:22:13.711 --> 00:22:14.711
Pil Joo...

239
00:22:15.971 --> 00:22:17.681
won't be able to...

240
00:22:18.541 --> 00:22:20.380
reveal your secret easily to others...

241
00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:23.011
- because... - If I resign,

242
00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.920
Yeo Cheon will fill my position.

243
00:22:27.521 --> 00:22:29.521
Right. That's right.

244
00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:33.160
He thinks so little of me.

245
00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:37.600
But, Mom.

246
00:22:40.031 --> 00:22:42.100
I think Pil Joo has...

247
00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:44.600
a personal vendetta against us.

248
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:52.610
If not, he wouldn't have concealed himself for 20 years.

249
00:22:55.481 --> 00:22:56.610
I...

250
00:22:57.781 --> 00:22:59.580
can't even guess what it could be.

251
00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:02.451
Boo Cheon.

252
00:23:03.491 --> 00:23:05.021
Why did he do this?

253
00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:17.100
Go and get some rest.

254
00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:27.511
The best thing I've ever done for my son...

255
00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.741
is keeping you beside him.

256
00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.011
Just like always,

257
00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:36.011
you didn't let me down...

258
00:24:37.021 --> 00:24:39.850
and came back, Pil Joo.

259
00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:43.221
Saying that having you by my side...

260
00:24:45.221 --> 00:24:48.160
is my luck would be an understatement.

261
00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:52.201
I'm certain the universe is on my side.

262
00:24:52.431 --> 00:24:53.501
You...

263
00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:56.531
don't know how sincere...

264
00:24:57.041 --> 00:24:58.441
Pil Joo looks.

265
00:24:59.971 --> 00:25:00.971
His eyes.

266
00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:04.211
Someone with his eyes can't betray me.

267
00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.251
I am the only one...

268
00:25:08.681 --> 00:25:10.451
who gave you this much money to you...

269
00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:13.350
in your life, right?

270
00:25:16.491 --> 00:25:17.660
You're pathetic,

271
00:25:18.791 --> 00:25:19.920
Jung Mal Ran.

272
00:25:28.931 --> 00:25:30.600
I've done nothing wrong.

273
00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:35.441
Kang Pil Joo who deceived me...

274
00:25:36.771 --> 00:25:37.880
is the evil one...

275
00:25:39.541 --> 00:25:40.681
and the jerk.

276
00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:51.221
I cannot fully understand...

277
00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:54.961
the dire time...

278
00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:57.830
and pain...

279
00:25:59.801 --> 00:26:00.801
the boy...

280
00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:07.110
who walked into the water had,

281
00:26:09.971 --> 00:26:11.910
so I couldn't dare to tell you...

282
00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:15.410
to give up on your revenge...

283
00:26:18.021 --> 00:26:19.820
and leave with me.

284
00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:28.090
So I'm leaving you...

285
00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:33.870
behind at Mooshimwon.

286
00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.140
Mal Ran.

287
00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:27.120
You are still the first one to come to work...

288
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:28.721
at Cheong A.

289
00:27:28.751 --> 00:27:32.120
But today, you came before I did.

290
00:27:32.721 --> 00:27:35.461
I'm worried if there is a problem.

291
00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:40.731
The tiger has revealed his claws.

292
00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:46.701
Pil Joo...

293
00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:49.140
is Jang Eun Cheon,

294
00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.181
a son Soo Man had out of wedlock.

295
00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:56.681
So Eun Cheon...

296
00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:00.051
has been alive all this time?

297
00:28:02.751 --> 00:28:06.090
Since my brother's sons didn't show up,

298
00:28:06.221 --> 00:28:07.791
I assumed they would be dead.

299
00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:10.431
I just let it go...

300
00:28:12.231 --> 00:28:15.201
after feeling bad for them.

301
00:28:17.471 --> 00:28:19.971
And you're saying that my oldest nephew is alive.

302
00:28:22.711 --> 00:28:25.140
And he is Kang Pil Joo of anyone.

303
00:28:33.691 --> 00:28:36.521
The tiger has gotten himself wings now.

304
00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:40.160
A tiger with wings.

305
00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:47.870
Seong Man.

306
00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.140
If Pil Joo is Jang Eun Cheon,

307
00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:54.410
it isn't good news to you either.

308
00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.110
Mal Ran.

309
00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:03.610
This is my office.

310
00:29:04.521 --> 00:29:07.090
I always used to...

311
00:29:07.751 --> 00:29:09.951
visit you at Mooshimwon.

312
00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:13.660
But now, you're visiting me in my office.

313
00:29:15.791 --> 00:29:17.600
You dismissed me...

314
00:29:17.961 --> 00:29:19.761
when I advised you...

315
00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:23.271
to be careful of Pil Joo and treated me like a fool.

316
00:29:23.271 --> 00:29:24.801
But look what you've got yourself into.

317
00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:30.511
Mal Ran.

318
00:29:31.211 --> 00:29:33.781
Do a proper job if you are here to beg.

319
00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:42.291
Let's make...

320
00:29:42.951 --> 00:29:44.890
Pil Joo and Father leave Cheong A,

321
00:29:45.721 --> 00:29:48.360
split Cheong A into half,

322
00:29:49.191 --> 00:29:51.660
and give each half to Yeo Cheon and Boo Cheon.

323
00:29:53.801 --> 00:29:56.271
Since you personally came to my office,

324
00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:59.640
I think that I can take 80 percent of Cheong A...

325
00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.870
and give you 20 percent.

326
00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:05.580
Without embellishing anything,

327
00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:08.551
don't you think that I, Jang Seong Man,

328
00:30:09.051 --> 00:30:11.221
have the upper hand?

329
00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:17.221
Since I wouldn't want to hear I mistreated my nephew,

330
00:30:17.461 --> 00:30:18.761
I will give you a break.

331
00:30:19.291 --> 00:30:22.130
I'll take 60, and you'll take 40.

332
00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:25.301
I will divide the affiliated companies as well.

333
00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:28.501
Sure.

334
00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:31.771
We must hurry.

335
00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:36.140
When Father finds out Pil Joo is Jang Eun Cheon,

336
00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:39.281
Father will reject him at first for being born out of wedlock,

337
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:42.810
but since it's Pil Joo,

338
00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:44.920
he might...

339
00:30:45.781 --> 00:30:48.191
bend his principle of banning those born out of wedlock...

340
00:30:49.051 --> 00:30:50.590
from Cheong A.

341
00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:52.890
My goodness. My gosh.

342
00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:55.160
Even the thought makes me shudder.

343
00:30:57.031 --> 00:30:58.231
If that happens,

344
00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.370
it will be only a matter of time...

345
00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.170
before Pil Joo eats up...

346
00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:08.241
both Boo Cheon and Yeo Cheon.

347
00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:16.350
It could be possible that...

348
00:31:16.781 --> 00:31:19.681
Pil Joo has already revealed his identity to Grandfather.

349
00:31:21.491 --> 00:31:22.491
That's possible.

350
00:31:22.491 --> 00:31:24.961
Grandfather doesn't show his emotions.

351
00:31:25.521 --> 00:31:27.031
And Pil Joo is worse.

352
00:31:27.261 --> 00:31:28.931
Let me see.

353
00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:33.060
How should I solve this equation?

354
00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:39.170
It'd be easy if it was true that Boo Cheon wasn't my brother's son.

355
00:31:40.441 --> 00:31:41.570
If we had been lucky,

356
00:31:42.011 --> 00:31:45.580
we could have gotten rid of Pil Joo and Boo Cheon at the same time.

357
00:31:46.781 --> 00:31:47.810
It's a pity.

358
00:31:48.181 --> 00:31:51.420
What? What do you mean?

359
00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:53.120
What?

360
00:31:53.721 --> 00:31:55.951
It's nothing.

361
00:31:59.291 --> 00:32:01.660
But you're old enough now.

362
00:32:03.191 --> 00:32:04.600
I don't need to hide anything.

363
00:32:06.461 --> 00:32:07.570
In fact,

364
00:32:09.271 --> 00:32:11.370
I once had doubts...

365
00:32:11.701 --> 00:32:13.711
that Boo Cheon could have been born out of wedlock.

366
00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:17.310
Why did you?

367
00:32:19.511 --> 00:32:20.910
My brother had...

368
00:32:21.551 --> 00:32:23.410
told me something when he was drunk.

369
00:32:40.431 --> 00:32:41.630
Seong Man.

370
00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:44.771
You should feel sorry...

371
00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.410
for my wife too.

372
00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:51.541
So...

373
00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:56.051
even if Boo Cheon isn't my son,

374
00:32:57.681 --> 00:32:58.721
I...

375
00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:02.320
am trying to love him even more.

376
00:33:06.261 --> 00:33:09.830
It turned out to be his misunderstanding in the end.

377
00:33:12.531 --> 00:33:15.031
We took a DNA test of you and Boo Cheon,

378
00:33:16.531 --> 00:33:18.041
and the result said that you were cousins.

379
00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:23.640
I'll take care of everything. From now on,

380
00:33:24.011 --> 00:33:27.350
you only need to prove that you are a prepared chairman.

381
00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:29.380
Yes, Father.

382
00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:32.281
You should have all three meals with the board members.

383
00:33:32.951 --> 00:33:34.620
Avoid drinking,

384
00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:37.191
but if you must, only drink between meals.

385
00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:40.291
Remember all the numbers on the accounting reports...

386
00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:43.931
of affiliated companies up to 10,000 dollars.

387
00:33:44.231 --> 00:33:45.961
If you can remember everything right,

388
00:33:46.201 --> 00:33:49.471
the board members won't ever look down on you.

389
00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:53.041
They will think...

390
00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:56.011
that you have better management skills than others.

391
00:33:56.610 --> 00:33:57.681
Yes.

392
00:33:57.981 --> 00:33:59.380
Yeo Cheon,

393
00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:01.880
is your promise to...

394
00:34:02.711 --> 00:34:04.650
make me a chairman...

395
00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:06.850
so that I can retire in honor still valid?

396
00:34:08.621 --> 00:34:09.820
Of course, Father.

I'm sorry I came here without calling you.

404
00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:05.781
Thank you for introducing me to a good attorney.

405
00:35:06.181 --> 00:35:07.781
I think he's great.

406

Is that why you wanted to meet me?

407
00:35:11.951 --> 00:35:14.790
About Cheong A Public Welfare Foundation that was established...

408
00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:16.650
from funds raised after listing Daeil Distribution...

409
00:35:17.121 --> 00:35:18.261
Yes?

410
00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:37.141
The accounting for the foundation...

411
00:35:37.681 --> 00:35:39.610
is being managed doubly again,

412
00:35:40.911 --> 00:35:42.851
just like Cheong A Welfare Foundation...

413
00:35:43.311 --> 00:35:44.851
and Cheong A Culture Foundation.

414
00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:46.621
They will take care of...

415
00:35:47.351 --> 00:35:49.290
their work by themselves.

416
00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:50.690
You...

417
00:35:51.261 --> 00:35:54.130
are in charge of Cheong A Welfare Foundation. Why are you...

418
00:35:54.991 --> 00:35:56.690
You gave money...

419
00:35:58.061 --> 00:35:59.531
raised this way as lobby funds...

420
00:36:00.031 --> 00:36:01.831
to my father, didn't you?

421
00:36:05.701 --> 00:36:08.710
Aide Yang merely received funds from Cheong A.

422
00:36:09.911 --> 00:36:12.181
He didn't know where the money came from.

423
00:36:16.081 --> 00:36:17.951
It was Cheong A's double accounting.

424
00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:22.690
I'm going to find out the password and try to open it.

425
00:36:26.491 --> 00:36:27.690
I'm probably going to find you...

426
00:36:29.331 --> 00:36:31.400
at the end of my investigation.

427
00:36:44.511 --> 00:36:45.581

two favorite people are here together.

429
00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:50.420
Why did you come here?

430
00:36:51.181 --> 00:36:53.020
I think the foundation that was created after...

431
00:36:53.551 --> 00:36:55.391
listing Daeil Distribution has a management problem.

432
00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:57.391
I came here to ask him about it.

433
00:36:58.161 --> 00:36:59.391
You came to the right person.

434
00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:01.460
He's in charge.

435
00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:06.031
He didn't give me a straight answer.

436
00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:10.440
Mo Hyun,

437
00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:14.311
do as you want.

438
00:37:15.241 --> 00:37:17.281
You don't need to care about what others think about it.

439
00:37:18.181 --> 00:37:20.210
Do everything...

440
00:37:22.681 --> 00:37:24.081
you feel like doing.

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.601
our attorneys...

443
00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:42.601
will be trying to reach an agreement...

444
00:37:42.931 --> 00:37:44.540
with the judge.

445
00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:48.371
It won't be easy for you to win this case.

446
00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:51.681
My attorney assured me that...

447
00:37:52.081 --> 00:37:54.380
alimony and the division of assets will all go well.

448
00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:55.681
Of course.

449
00:37:56.610 --> 00:37:58.081
It won't be easy to make an excuse...

450
00:37:59.281 --> 00:38:01.221
for Seo Won and Ha Jung.

451

By the way,

452
00:38:06.161 --> 00:38:08.561
there won't be any articles about our divorce.

453

I'm going to deliver the court's ruling.

the Strategy Team's jobs to the Cheong A Bio Share Holding Company.

there aren't any problems during the transfer.

There won't be any if we follow the plan...

made by Attorney Kang.

469
00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:18.721
No,

470
00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:20.460
of course not.

471
00:40:28.031 --> 00:40:29.971
I didn't like the part about...

472
00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:32.201
giving more power to the board of directors...

473
00:40:33.471 --> 00:40:35.770
and focusing more about social opinions...

Me neither.

476
00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:41.281
We need to think about that again.

477
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:45.121
If the Strategy Team gets dissolved...

478
00:40:45.181 --> 00:40:47.991
and the board of directors gains more power,

479
00:40:47.991 --> 00:40:50.360

486

the first priority?

495

Also, don't forget that...

496
00:42:18.741 --> 00:42:21.051
making Cheong A Group the holding company is my management policy.

497

00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:35.781
I feel uncomfortable to share my days...

515
00:44:36.051 --> 00:44:37.250
with you.

516
00:44:41.721 --> 00:44:43.020
Forgive me, Father.

517
00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:45.920
It's upsetting.

518
00:45:16.391 --> 00:45:18.820
Grandfather. Aunt. Hello.

519
00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:19.891
What brings you here?

520
00:45:19.891 --> 00:45:23.801
I stopped by to say hello while I was passing by.

521
00:45:24.130 --> 00:45:25.161
Good job.

522
00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:27.400
Secretary Ahn.

523
00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:33.540
Naengmyeon's getting ready.

524
00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:35.670
- I'll go wash my hands. - Okay.

525
00:46:06.371 --> 00:46:08.570
If you cut just once, it's still too long.

526
00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:09.811
Cut more for him.

527
00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:23.661
- Yeo Cheon. - Yes, Grandfather.

528
00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:26.661
Since I'm bored,

529
00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:31.000
in the facility area...

530
00:46:31.661 --> 00:46:34.400
I mean... Oh, yes.

531
00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:36.601
I'm going to build a second home.

532
00:46:38.301 --> 00:46:40.871
Grandfather. Does that mean...

533
00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:45.210
Hyun Joo and I are going to move into that house?

534
00:46:45.241 --> 00:46:47.380
Yes. You actually thought about...

535
00:46:47.581 --> 00:46:50.520
moving in here after kicking your aunt and Boo Cheon...

536
00:46:50.621 --> 00:46:52.351
out of here.

537
00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:54.491
Father.

538
00:46:55.290 --> 00:46:57.290
I'm not telling you to move out.

539
00:46:57.590 --> 00:47:00.221
It's a second home. Second.

540
00:47:01.031 --> 00:47:02.261
Grandfather.

541
00:47:02.431 --> 00:47:06.061
Since you're building a new one, make a big bathroom please.

542
00:47:06.061 --> 00:47:08.801
Sure. Let's make it as big as the master bedroom.

543
00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:12.770
Thank you, Grandfather.

544
00:47:13.301 --> 00:47:15.911
I've already dreamed of living in Mooshimwon since I was young.

545
00:47:15.911 --> 00:47:17.840
Why would you dream it?

546
00:47:18.110 --> 00:47:21.650
You could've just asked me.

547
00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:59.520
Just like you requested,

548
00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:03.721
I'll bring Boo Cheon down from his position...

549
00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:06.190
and leave.

550
00:48:09.661 --> 00:48:10.661
But...

551
00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:13.531
give me some time.

552
00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:17.340
I can't wait long.

553
00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:23.011
Thank you.

554
00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:29.411
Your eyes.

555
00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:32.451
They were...

556
00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:35.790
always firm...

557
00:48:37.221 --> 00:48:38.761
when you looked at me.

558
00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:43.801
Those eyes that shined sedately.

559
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:49.230
Now I realize...

560
00:48:51.741 --> 00:48:53.340
they shined...

561
00:48:54.411 --> 00:48:55.971
for revenge.

562
00:48:59.210 --> 00:49:00.610
I was a sunflower...

563
00:49:03.210 --> 00:49:04.380
every day...

564
00:49:06.681 --> 00:49:08.090
following those lights...

565
00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:12.790
without realizing it.

566
00:49:15.931 --> 00:49:17.960
How could I have been so stupid?

567
00:49:22.301 --> 00:49:23.331
Just the fact that...

568
00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:27.940
you're not Kang Pil Joo,

569
00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:32.241
but someone else...

570
00:49:34.610 --> 00:49:37.351
breaks my heart.

571
00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:41.491
You're...

572
00:49:43.891 --> 00:49:45.420
not just anybody,

573
00:49:48.031 --> 00:49:49.491
but Jang Eun Cheon.

574
00:49:57.170 --> 00:49:59.400
It can't get any worse than this.

575
00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:13.351
If your goal was not to...

576
00:50:15.051 --> 00:50:17.460
bite and rip Boo Cheon and me,

577
00:50:19.790 --> 00:50:22.290
you've already succeeded your revenge, Pil Joo.

578
00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:26.661
You made Boo Cheon and me...

579
00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:30.840
rely on you completely.

580
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:36.641
I've raised a flag of truce to you.

581
00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:41.250
Even during the war,

582
00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:44.581
they don't attack...

583
00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:47.420
the person who raised a flag of truce...

584
00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:49.690
and treat them nicely.

585
00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:52.020
I'm going to...

586
00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:55.630
file a nullity suit...

587
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:58.601
on fortune Boo Cheon received from Honorary Chairman Jang.

588
00:51:00.971 --> 00:51:02.031
What?

589
00:51:02.031 --> 00:51:04.471
The shares you obtained within the last 10 years...

590
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.770
and the profit made due to rise in stock price...

591
00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:10.980
You have to give up all of them.

592
00:51:13.781 --> 00:51:14.911
The lawsuit won't be...

593
00:51:17.051 --> 00:51:19.851
brought in without Honorary Chairman's consent.

594
00:51:24.090 --> 00:51:25.290
It seems like...

595
00:51:27.391 --> 00:51:29.391
Honorary Chairman knows that Boo Cheon isn't...

596
00:51:30.161 --> 00:51:31.661
the son of the Jangs.

597
00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:39.641
He has never...

598
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:43.710
brought up this topic...

599
00:51:45.311 --> 00:51:47.650
even if he knows that Boo Cheon isn't his grandson.

600
00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:50.551
Would he agree...

601
00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:53.121
to go on a lawsuit...

602
00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:55.551
when it is likely to be leaked to outside?

603
00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:57.391
I, Kang Pil Joo,

604
00:51:59.761 --> 00:52:01.130
will make that happen...

605
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.601
as always.

606
00:52:14.610 --> 00:52:22.551
(Mooshimwon)

607
00:52:57.980 --> 00:53:00.690
(Unmatched)

608
00:53:01.391 --> 00:53:03.820
(Paternal blood relationship is not proven.)

609
00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:04.820
So Pil Joo...

610
00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:07.261
drew his own blood...

611
00:53:09.031 --> 00:53:11.301
and completely fooled me?

612
00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:14.670
What will you do now?

613
00:53:15.730 --> 00:53:18.471
If your grandfather calls me over,

614
00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:23.040
it will go exactly according to our scenario.

615
00:53:25.811 --> 00:53:27.411
If I bring it to him,

616
00:53:27.551 --> 00:53:29.581
he might yell at me...

617
00:53:30.551 --> 00:53:32.681
for spreading such dirty rumor.

618
00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:37.991
Until when should I wait then?

619
00:53:39.721 --> 00:53:40.831
Let's see...

620
00:53:40.831 --> 00:53:42.761
(Father)

621
00:53:43.730 --> 00:53:45.831
(Father)

622
00:53:54.971 --> 00:53:57.811
(Father)

623
00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:01.681
Yes, Father.

624
00:54:03.281 --> 00:54:06.281
Father, there's no need to worry.

625
00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:08.190
Your pure-blooded son,

626
00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:11.221
Seong Man, is right in front of you.

627
00:54:12.261 --> 00:54:15.130
Also, you have my son Yeo Cheon...

628
00:54:15.261 --> 00:54:17.101
who is your perfect grandson.

629
00:54:20.061 --> 00:54:22.871
You wasted such a long time...

630
00:54:23.570 --> 00:54:26.570
being mocked by Mal Ran and Boo Cheon...

631
00:54:26.570 --> 00:54:27.911
and paying attention to clever Pil Joo.

632
00:54:28.871 --> 00:54:32.281
Yeo Cheon and I will compensate your time, Father.

633
00:54:32.610 --> 00:54:34.081
I'm glad to hear that.

634
00:54:34.551 --> 00:54:36.750
We, noble and perfect members of the Jangs,

635
00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:38.250
must protect Cheong A.

636
00:54:38.351 --> 00:54:40.081
Definitely, we will.

637
00:54:40.991 --> 00:54:43.150
Would you tell me briefly...

638
00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:45.561
about the big picture...

639
00:54:46.221 --> 00:54:48.130
you drew then?

640
00:54:48.130 --> 00:54:49.561
That's not necessary.

641
00:54:49.690 --> 00:54:52.460
I will take care of all the complicated matters.

642
00:54:52.661 --> 00:54:54.070
I just want you and Yeo Cheon...

643
00:54:54.471 --> 00:54:57.900
to focus on promoting future growth...

644
00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:00.270
of Cheong A.

645
00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:04.340
All right, Father.

646
00:55:16.690 --> 00:55:17.790
Well,

647
00:55:19.261 --> 00:55:21.960
I think you also need to know this.

648
00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:25.161
Actually, Pil Joo is...

649
00:55:26.801 --> 00:55:27.900
Jang Eun Cheon.

650
00:55:29.301 --> 00:55:32.101
He's the son of my father, the real Jangs.

651
00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:38.710
Did you know this?

652
00:55:40.210 --> 00:55:41.281
I did.

653
00:55:42.511 --> 00:55:43.721
How?

654
00:55:45.351 --> 00:55:46.480
The necklace.

655
00:55:49.150 --> 00:55:51.621
The necklace I found near the river when I was in middle school...

656
00:55:52.261 --> 00:55:53.931
was the one Mr. Kang lost.

657
00:55:55.331 --> 00:55:57.230
And Ms. Icheon recognized it.

658
00:55:57.730 --> 00:55:58.960
You met...

659
00:56:00.130 --> 00:56:01.170
Pil Joo...

660
00:56:06.241 --> 00:56:07.340
when you were young?

661
00:56:10.141 --> 00:56:12.610
I was watching birds on the riverbank...

662
00:56:14.451 --> 00:56:15.951
and ran into a boy...

663
00:56:16.650 --> 00:56:18.750
walking into the river with a funeral urn.

664
00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:23.121
He walked into the river...

665
00:56:24.590 --> 00:56:26.460
but didn't come out after a few minutes.

666
00:56:27.061 --> 00:56:29.261
So I jumped into the river and saved him.

667
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:35.570
The boy was Kang Pil Joo.

668
00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:38.101
Pil Joo went...

669
00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:41.770
to prison for me,

670
00:56:43.741 --> 00:56:46.241
and his foster father died while he was in there.

671
00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:51.081
I sent Pil Joo to prison,

672
00:56:52.551 --> 00:56:53.551
but you...

673
00:56:57.621 --> 00:56:59.121
saved him.

674
00:57:02.790 --> 00:57:04.460
You saved Pil Joo trying to take his own life.

675
00:57:04.661 --> 00:57:07.101
I found the necklace Pil Joo lost...

676
00:57:08.170 --> 00:57:09.400
near the river.

677
00:57:11.371 --> 00:57:13.400
I couldn't give it back...

678
00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:16.270
as he had already left the town. So I kept it.

679
00:57:17.311 --> 00:57:19.710
After he left the town, he came to my house...

680
00:57:20.451 --> 00:57:21.951
and asked me to be a friend.

681
00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:29.320
Do you know...

682
00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:31.391
why he came to my house?

683
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:38.561
I need to know the truth too. Please tell me...

684
00:57:38.831 --> 00:57:40.031
everything you know.

685
00:57:46.371 --> 00:57:48.710
I even gave him CPR to save him,

686
00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:50.980
but he tried to walk into the water again.

687
00:57:54.181 --> 00:57:55.411
I think he saw...

688
00:57:56.011 --> 00:57:59.250
illusions of his mom and brother who drowned when he was little.

689
00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:05.061
Maybe, somebody tried...

690
00:58:06.761 --> 00:58:08.360
to drown all three of them.

691
00:58:14.170 --> 00:58:15.701
That someone must be...

692
00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:17.500
Then...

693
00:58:28.411 --> 00:58:30.451
Pil Joo came to get back at Mom.

694
00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:34.520
That was the reason.

695
00:58:38.790 --> 00:58:40.531
I'll drive Boo Cheon and Executive Jung out...

696
00:58:40.991 --> 00:58:42.960
in my own way.

697
00:58:43.161 --> 00:58:44.801
Please leave it to me...

698
00:58:45.331 --> 00:58:48.130
and consent to filing a suit to nullify transfer...

699
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:52.070
of the property you bequeathed beforehand.

700
00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:53.770
Attorney Kang.

701
00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:56.770
Stop whatever nonsense you're up to.

702
00:58:57.980 --> 00:59:01.650
You think you can take the place of Boo Cheon and Executive Jung...

703
00:59:02.051 --> 00:59:04.681
after kicking them out, don't you?

704
00:59:06.851 --> 00:59:10.121
If I let an out-of-wedlock birth like you run Cheong A,

705
00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:13.491
all the classless jerks will try to take advantage of Cheong A.

706
00:59:13.690 --> 00:59:15.561
I can't let it happen.

707
00:59:15.690 --> 00:59:18.061
Our legitimacy must not be damaged.

708
00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:20.031
You estranged my mother from Father...

709
00:59:20.431 --> 00:59:21.971
although he loved her...

710
00:59:22.931 --> 00:59:25.641
and made him marry the daughter of the bank president who lent money.

711
00:59:26.701 --> 00:59:27.710
Is that...

712
00:59:28.110 --> 00:59:29.610
the legitimacy you mean?

713
00:59:29.811 --> 00:59:31.081
Attorney Kang.

714
00:59:31.911 --> 00:59:34.980
I didn't force your dad to marry the woman.

715
00:59:37.181 --> 00:59:40.491
He decided to stay within the family as he couldn't give up money.

716
00:59:40.790 --> 00:59:41.951
Indeed.

717
00:59:42.491 --> 00:59:44.621
The fortune was too big to ignore.

718
00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:48.960
Isn't it also Cheong A's money that you want?

719
00:59:50.290 --> 00:59:53.900
Under the guise of revenge, you aim to get money in the end.

720
00:59:54.570 --> 00:59:56.531
Be honest, Attorney Kang.

721
01:00:06.411 --> 01:00:08.351
Go inside. It's cold.

722
01:00:09.011 --> 01:00:10.110
Boo Cheon.

723
01:00:13.650 --> 01:00:15.991
I don't want to see you again for a while.

724
01:00:17.121 --> 01:00:18.221
Why not?

725
01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:21.391
I want to put an end to our relationship with divorce.

726
01:00:23.761 --> 01:00:26.061
I know you still want me...

727
01:00:26.801 --> 01:00:27.971
and love me.

728
01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:31.641
But I can't embrace it,

729
01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:36.110
so I think we should stop seeing each other.

730
01:00:38.911 --> 01:00:39.911
Mo Hyun.

731
01:01:24.661 --> 01:01:25.690
We need to talk.

732
01:01:25.891 --> 01:01:28.061
I'll wait for you at Yong Goo's studio.

733
01:03:39.991 --> 01:03:41.460
Open the door, Pil Joo!

734
01:03:42.831 --> 01:03:43.931
Kang Pil Joo!

735
01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:53.911
Kang Pil Joo! Kang Pil Joo!

736
01:04:01.610 --> 01:04:03.511
(Will)

737
01:04:03.511 --> 01:04:06.420
(Testator: Jang Boo Cheon)

738
01:05:56.261 --> 01:05:59.130
(Money Flower)
