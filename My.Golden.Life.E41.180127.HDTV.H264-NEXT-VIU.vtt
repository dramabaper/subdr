3
00:00:06.985 --> 00:00:09.654
Mr. Kim. I didn't expect you. What brings you here?

4
00:00:27.505 --> 00:00:30.375
So this was where you were. Both of you.

5
00:00:40.215 --> 00:00:41.684
(Episode 41)

6
00:00:44.054 --> 00:00:45.084
Are you having snacks?

7
00:00:46.325 --> 00:00:47.755
Can you give us some privacy?

8
00:00:49.224 --> 00:00:51.124
Which one of you owns this house?

9
00:00:55.065 --> 00:00:57.535
I'm sorry. I think we should go upstairs.

10
00:00:57.705 --> 00:00:59.364
- Sure. - Okay.

11
00:01:08.645 --> 00:01:10.015
You go wait outside too.

12
00:01:13.815 --> 00:01:14.985
Grandfather.

13
00:01:15.054 --> 00:01:16.285
Shut your mouth.

14
00:01:17.155 --> 00:01:19.285
Grandfather, there has been a misunderstanding.

15
00:01:19.354 --> 00:01:20.994
There's nothing going on between Ji An and me.

16
00:01:21.224 --> 00:01:22.625
This is just a sharehouse.

17
00:01:26.735 --> 00:01:28.265
Hello, sir.

18
00:01:30.065 --> 00:01:32.134
I'd like to talk with the landlord.

19
00:01:34.735 --> 00:01:38.274
Grandfather, please. You can talk with me.

20
00:01:39.614 --> 00:01:40.645
Take a seat.

21
00:01:42.145 --> 00:01:43.185
Sit down.

22
00:01:47.455 --> 00:01:49.315
Didn't Mom tell you?

23
00:01:50.785 --> 00:01:51.824
Right.

24
00:01:52.724 --> 00:01:54.494
You came up with a very nice story.

25
00:01:56.125 --> 00:01:57.824
You told her that you're learning things.

26
00:01:59.224 --> 00:02:01.164
And you said you're not interested in Haesung...

27
00:02:01.164 --> 00:02:03.535
but Do Kyung is chasing after you.

28
00:02:05.634 --> 00:02:09.745
That wasn't a lie. It was true, but we ended it.

29
00:02:10.674 --> 00:02:11.974
I decided to stop.

30
00:02:12.674 --> 00:02:14.644
- What? - It's the truth.

31
00:02:15.174 --> 00:02:19.115
I'm moving back home by the end of the month.

32
00:02:21.014 --> 00:02:23.555
Why would you do that? Just stay in this house.

33
00:02:24.954 --> 00:02:27.555
- Sorry? - I'll buy you this house.

34
00:02:30.324 --> 00:02:32.164
His offer is three times the current value.

35
00:02:34.095 --> 00:02:37.035
How can my grandson live like this?

36
00:02:38.005 --> 00:02:40.104
You're living with other people in a small house.

37
00:02:40.204 --> 00:02:43.644
How can your relationship develop in this place?

38
00:02:44.905 --> 00:02:47.115
The two of you must live together, right?

39
00:02:48.974 --> 00:02:49.984
Grandfather.

40
00:02:50.384 --> 00:02:54.255
You must've been sad that he left home empty-handed.

41
00:03:03.694 --> 00:03:04.894
Sell the house to me.

42
00:03:05.995 --> 00:03:07.935
I'm not interested in selling this house.

43
00:03:13.275 --> 00:03:15.775
That's five times the current market price.

44
00:03:17.144 --> 00:03:20.715
I'll buy you this house. So kick everyone out,

45
00:03:21.944 --> 00:03:23.285
and try living with Ji An.

46
00:03:26.615 --> 00:03:29.555
What are you saying? Please stop this.

47
00:03:31.155 --> 00:03:33.954
Let me officially introduce myself, Mr. No.

48
00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:36.924
I'm Lee Yong Gook, the grandson...

49
00:03:36.924 --> 00:03:39.935
of Daeryun Corporation's Chairman, Lee Chul Min.

50
00:03:42.794 --> 00:03:45.865
You're the grandson of Chairman Lee?

51
00:03:45.865 --> 00:03:46.905
Yes, sir.

52
00:03:48.174 --> 00:03:49.745
We've met when I was young.

53
00:03:50.204 --> 00:03:51.574
It was during the early days of N-Gaon.

54
00:03:52.505 --> 00:03:54.544
Yes. I heard you dropped out.

55
00:03:56.115 --> 00:03:57.544
Are you the landlord?

56
00:03:57.544 --> 00:04:00.454
Yes, I run this sharehouse.

57
00:04:00.715 --> 00:04:03.824
I won't sell it because it's very valuable to me.

58
00:04:07.125 --> 00:04:11.424
Are you the CEO of Mamdaero too?

59
00:04:11.565 --> 00:04:14.095
Yes, I'm the Co-CEO.

60
00:04:15.035 --> 00:04:17.005
So I won't be able to...

61
00:04:17.505 --> 00:04:19.334
touch the shopping mall and woodworking studio.

62
00:04:20.475 --> 00:04:23.605
My father and grandfather gave me their permission.

63
00:04:25.175 --> 00:04:26.915
I should prepare a new plan.

64
00:04:29.444 --> 00:04:31.985
You are very competent.

65
00:04:35.415 --> 00:04:36.725
Please stop.

66
00:04:38.784 --> 00:04:40.324
Then come back home.

67
00:04:40.324 --> 00:04:42.694
You had your way when you kicked me out,

68
00:04:43.225 --> 00:04:44.865
but I will decide when to return.

69
00:05:01.245 --> 00:05:04.485
Sir, everything Do Kyung said is true.

70
00:05:07.084 --> 00:05:09.725
There's nothing going on between those two.

71
00:05:10.154 --> 00:05:12.024
Ji An told me that she was moving out.

72
00:05:12.024 --> 00:05:14.925
Why do you waste your life on a useless business?

73
00:05:15.824 --> 00:05:18.365
When I heard you were an investor...

74
00:05:18.365 --> 00:05:20.735
for social enterprises, I thought it was pathetic.

75
00:05:21.365 --> 00:05:23.134
Everyone has a different opinion.

76
00:05:23.534 --> 00:05:25.665
I'm having fun with my work.

77
00:05:31.305 --> 00:05:32.704
Say hello to the chairman for me.

78
00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:34.375
I will.

79
00:05:54.235 --> 00:05:55.235
I'm sorry.

80
00:05:57.605 --> 00:05:59.505
Why are you sorry?

81
00:05:59.774 --> 00:06:01.735
You didn't humiliate me.

82
00:06:07.644 --> 00:06:10.014
You don't need to feel sorry. There's no need.

83
00:06:11.014 --> 00:06:13.355
I was already preparing myself for it.

84
00:06:15.454 --> 00:06:18.985
I didn't expect that he'd say such things though.

85
00:06:20.654 --> 00:06:21.654
What's going on?

86
00:06:22.725 --> 00:06:24.824
Why aren't you mad? Aren't you upset?

87
00:06:24.824 --> 00:06:27.665
Yes, I am. I'm very upset.

88
00:06:29.194 --> 00:06:32.134
But I don't want to take it out on you.

89
00:06:33.305 --> 00:06:34.334
Why not?

90
00:06:35.375 --> 00:06:37.605
I expected that he'd be harsh on me.

91
00:06:38.045 --> 00:06:39.774
I already knew how he is.

92
00:06:40.375 --> 00:06:42.714
I won't be upset by him. He's not worth it.

93
00:06:48.485 --> 00:06:52.024
Right now, it must be hard for you the most.

94
00:06:54.594 --> 00:06:56.524
Do Kyung, I feel so bad for you.

95
00:06:58.065 --> 00:07:00.394
I rejected you, and your family is bullying you.

96
00:07:03.105 --> 00:07:04.404
I'm ashamed...

97
00:07:05.435 --> 00:07:06.675
to face you.

98
00:07:11.875 --> 00:07:13.074
My gosh.

99
00:07:13.514 --> 00:07:14.545
He just left.

100
00:07:15.214 --> 00:07:16.714
He's still going strong.

101
00:07:17.045 --> 00:07:18.514
I'm going to get some fresh air.

102
00:07:36.605 --> 00:07:38.735
How dare you patronize me?

103
00:07:38.865 --> 00:07:41.375
That's why I hate your family.

104
00:07:41.375 --> 00:07:45.105
I won't go even if you kneel down to beg me.

105
00:07:47.514 --> 00:07:48.944
If it wasn't Do Kyung's family,

106
00:07:48.944 --> 00:07:50.514
I would've wanted to report it to the press.

107
00:07:57.524 --> 00:08:00.594
Why? Why? Why?

108
00:08:00.594 --> 00:08:03.024
Why are you doing this, Grandfather?

109
00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:05.995
I can't go against my family.

110
00:08:05.995 --> 00:08:07.995
You go beyond my imagination.

111
00:08:07.995 --> 00:08:12.975
This is why Ji An doesn't like me. This is why.

112
00:08:19.545 --> 00:08:20.875
What was that?

113
00:08:21.975 --> 00:08:23.144
This is fun.

114
00:08:25.084 --> 00:08:26.985
I used to play this often with Ji Soo.

115
00:08:30.755 --> 00:08:32.255
What you said...

116
00:08:33.325 --> 00:08:35.195
is becoming reality.

117
00:08:36.095 --> 00:08:38.164
I feel bitter and ashamed.

118
00:08:39.294 --> 00:08:41.064
Did you follow me?

119
00:08:41.664 --> 00:08:43.735
I was on my way out for an appointment.

120
00:08:45.365 --> 00:08:46.875
Then you should go now.

121
00:08:47.534 --> 00:08:48.674
But...

122
00:08:49.335 --> 00:08:50.845
are you moving back home?

123
00:08:55.245 --> 00:08:56.245
When?

124
00:08:57.085 --> 00:09:00.255
In two days. I must do something by tomorrow.

125
00:09:00.985 --> 00:09:03.684
Shouldn't we have a farewell party then?

126
00:09:04.325 --> 00:09:06.995
There are no farewell parties in the sharehouse.

127
00:09:07.394 --> 00:09:08.995
They only throw welcome parties.

128
00:09:11.865 --> 00:09:13.294
I heard you are attending classes.

129
00:09:14.634 --> 00:09:15.894
It's fun.

130
00:09:17.434 --> 00:09:20.774
You really found your place now.

131
00:09:22.804 --> 00:09:23.845
Yes, fortunately.

132
00:09:26.345 --> 00:09:29.644
Do you know who invested in my business?

133
00:09:30.585 --> 00:09:32.684
Oh, right. Where did you get it?

134
00:09:32.814 --> 00:09:33.955
Who gave it to you?

135
00:09:34.784 --> 00:09:36.014
Secretary Yoo.

136
00:09:36.585 --> 00:09:37.684
My goodness.

137
00:09:38.024 --> 00:09:39.284
Isn't that unexpected?

138
00:09:40.424 --> 00:09:43.595
You must have been a good boss.

139
00:09:44.064 --> 00:09:45.825
I'm on my way to see him now.

140
00:09:46.394 --> 00:09:48.095
We are having a meeting.

141
00:09:48.735 --> 00:09:50.465
I hope it goes well.

142
00:09:51.804 --> 00:09:53.475
After seeing my grandfather,

143
00:09:54.205 --> 00:09:55.735
do you want to root for me?

144
00:09:57.945 --> 00:09:59.615
I want you to show them something...

145
00:10:02.375 --> 00:10:04.514
for your sake, Do Kyung.

146
00:10:06.784 --> 00:10:07.914
Thank you...

147
00:10:08.485 --> 00:10:09.755
for saying that.

148
00:10:11.284 --> 00:10:13.725
I was to go to the studio after the clean-up.

149
00:10:15.894 --> 00:10:17.965
Okay. Have a good day.

150
00:10:19.024 --> 00:10:20.495
You too, Do Kyung.

151
00:10:40.715 --> 00:10:42.654
- Father. - How could you not...

152
00:10:42.654 --> 00:10:45.054
have known Do Kyung and Ji An are living together?

153
00:10:46.154 --> 00:10:48.725
Do Kyung is living with Ji An?

154
00:10:53.595 --> 00:10:55.865
I couldn't tell you that Do Kyung was into Ji An...

155
00:10:56.735 --> 00:10:58.865
because I was worried about you...

156
00:10:58.865 --> 00:11:00.075
getting disappointed at Do Kyung.

157
00:11:02.105 --> 00:11:04.404
I will separate them right away.

158
00:11:04.475 --> 00:11:05.505
You can't do that.

159
00:11:10.284 --> 00:11:11.445
The owner of that house...

160
00:11:11.985 --> 00:11:13.085
is the grandson of Mr. Lee,

161
00:11:13.085 --> 00:11:14.585
the chairman of Daeryun Corporation,

162
00:11:14.585 --> 00:11:15.615
Lee Yong Gook.

163
00:11:18.654 --> 00:11:20.625
I know that boy.

164
00:11:21.054 --> 00:11:24.825
He's beyond our reach.

165
00:11:25.495 --> 00:11:27.564
He's like a snake coiled up.

166
00:11:29.394 --> 00:11:30.634
How did he end up there?

167
00:11:31.634 --> 00:11:33.274
Daeryun Corporation.

168
00:11:33.975 --> 00:11:34.975
So what do we do?

169
00:11:34.975 --> 00:11:36.505
You should've gotten rid of her...

170
00:11:36.505 --> 00:11:37.904
when you found out that it was her.

171
00:11:37.904 --> 00:11:39.105
Why did you let her go?

172
00:11:40.575 --> 00:11:42.745
Why isn't there anything you can do?

173
00:11:45.684 --> 00:11:47.154
Why is Ji Soo still here?

174
00:11:48.485 --> 00:11:50.725
I had to look for a decent school...

175
00:11:50.725 --> 00:11:51.855
and arrange things.

176
00:11:51.855 --> 00:11:54.725
You're always one step behind, aren't you?

177
00:11:55.455 --> 00:11:57.125
Why would you look for a school?

178
00:11:57.125 --> 00:11:59.465
She can go there first and look for one there.

179
00:11:59.865 --> 00:12:00.995
Ji Soo...

180
00:12:01.294 --> 00:12:03.934
ran away from the foundation day event.

181
00:12:04.404 --> 00:12:06.064
She's got a rebellious spirit.

182
00:12:06.705 --> 00:12:08.735
So you should either tame her well...

183
00:12:08.735 --> 00:12:11.404
or make sure she doesn't dare...

184
00:12:11.404 --> 00:12:12.745
to rebel against you.

185
00:12:12.845 --> 00:12:14.615
Or scare her if you have to.

186
00:12:15.475 --> 00:12:18.044
She's leaving the day after tomorrow.

187
00:12:19.514 --> 00:12:20.554
The day after tomorrow?

188
00:12:21.784 --> 00:12:23.884
I will study abroad.

189
00:12:24.424 --> 00:12:26.125
Let me leave as early as possible.

190
00:12:27.855 --> 00:12:29.154
The day after tomorrow?

191
00:12:29.924 --> 00:12:31.725
Next Monday or Wednesday?

192
00:12:31.725 --> 00:12:32.995
When do you want to go?

193
00:12:33.735 --> 00:12:35.195
I will go the day after tomorrow.

194
00:12:38.904 --> 00:12:41.304
You don't have to worry about Ji Soo now.

195
00:12:42.835 --> 00:12:44.144
That's good news.

196
00:12:45.544 --> 00:12:49.115
I will meet with Ji An again and settle things.

197
00:12:49.414 --> 00:12:51.945
She already said she is going back home.

198
00:12:51.945 --> 00:12:53.784
What would you say to her?

199
00:12:53.784 --> 00:12:55.654
You already met with her.

200
00:12:56.154 --> 00:12:58.625
When you act without reason,

201
00:12:58.625 --> 00:13:00.294
it might backfire.

202
00:13:00.995 --> 00:13:03.095
You will only provoke Do Kyung.

203
00:13:05.024 --> 00:13:06.264
Do Kyung said...

204
00:13:07.095 --> 00:13:08.934
he's given up on her.

205
00:13:09.434 --> 00:13:11.904
Did he give up?

206
00:13:12.404 --> 00:13:13.904
They're putting on a show.

207
00:13:14.804 --> 00:13:17.575
Even if Ji An is telling the truth,

208
00:13:17.575 --> 00:13:20.274
those are just words. That's how she feels now.

209
00:13:21.414 --> 00:13:23.184
People's minds change.

210
00:13:23.715 --> 00:13:25.414
That's why they are scary.

211
00:13:26.455 --> 00:13:29.284
You should never trust people.

212
00:13:30.625 --> 00:13:32.054
What did Do Kyung say?

213
00:13:32.054 --> 00:13:33.554
If he's given up on her,

214
00:13:33.554 --> 00:13:34.924
will he be coming home?

215
00:13:34.924 --> 00:13:36.524
He doesn't seem to be willing to come home.

216
00:13:37.024 --> 00:13:39.024
That's why I suspect that this is just a show.

217
00:13:41.095 --> 00:13:42.564
I am sorry, Father.

218
00:13:42.564 --> 00:13:43.564
I made a mistake...

219
00:13:43.934 --> 00:13:45.804
by bringing Ji An into our family.

220
00:13:45.835 --> 00:13:47.674
And she ended up getting involved with Do Kyung.

221
00:13:48.835 --> 00:13:51.245
If only Do Kyung wasn't the eldest...

222
00:13:52.575 --> 00:13:55.644
If only Jin Soo was older than Do Kyung...

223
00:14:01.855 --> 00:14:05.325
Ji Soo, what did you just say?

224
00:14:06.085 --> 00:14:08.195
Did you say you're quitting?

225
00:14:09.394 --> 00:14:10.424
Yes.

226
00:14:10.695 --> 00:14:13.195
I am sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

227
00:14:13.195 --> 00:14:14.564
Why are you...

228
00:14:14.764 --> 00:14:17.904
Ji Soo's family owns Haesung Corporation.

229
00:14:19.164 --> 00:14:20.235
Is it...

230
00:14:20.835 --> 00:14:22.835
because of my brother-in-law?

231
00:14:24.544 --> 00:14:26.475
I will work only until tomorrow.

232
00:14:27.075 --> 00:14:28.245
Did you...

233
00:14:28.745 --> 00:14:31.544
really think this through?

234
00:14:32.245 --> 00:14:33.585
Did you decide this?

235
00:14:34.115 --> 00:14:36.085
Of course I did.

236
00:14:38.455 --> 00:14:41.455
Is there anything you want to tell me...

237
00:14:41.455 --> 00:14:42.965
or I can help you with?

238
00:14:43.394 --> 00:14:45.294
No. There's no such thing.

239
00:14:47.235 --> 00:14:48.235
I am sorry.

240
00:14:57.375 --> 00:15:00.414
"No matter what you do, you will be successful."

241
00:15:01.274 --> 00:15:03.445
"I will watch you from afar..."

242
00:15:03.445 --> 00:15:05.485
"and root for you."

243
00:15:08.755 --> 00:15:11.225
She hasn't written a comment in a long time.

244
00:15:15.325 --> 00:15:17.225
The person who came in when you were leaving...

245
00:15:17.825 --> 00:15:19.564
is the chairman of Haesung Corporation.

246
00:15:19.934 --> 00:15:20.934
"Haesung Corporation"?

247
00:15:24.835 --> 00:15:26.235
They're unbelievable, aren't they?

248
00:15:28.335 --> 00:15:30.205
Ji An must've felt really bad.

249
00:15:30.544 --> 00:15:33.345
I was impressed by Ji An today.

250
00:15:33.774 --> 00:15:35.674
She wouldn't just feel bad.

251
00:15:36.514 --> 00:15:37.784
She must feel insulted.

252
00:15:38.845 --> 00:15:40.115
But she took it well.

253
00:15:40.215 --> 00:15:41.514
She's an adult.

254
00:15:41.514 --> 00:15:45.054
No. She did it for Do Kyung.

255
00:15:45.524 --> 00:15:47.595
She saw Do Kyung's face turning pale.

256
00:15:47.654 --> 00:15:50.264
Are all rich people like that?

257
00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:52.195
You said this the other time.

258
00:15:52.195 --> 00:15:53.965
You said people in your world...

259
00:15:53.965 --> 00:15:55.235
can't date ordinary people.

260
00:15:55.764 --> 00:15:57.034
Is this what you mean?

261
00:15:57.034 --> 00:15:59.005
Not all rich people are the same.

262
00:15:59.264 --> 00:16:01.404
But look around.

263
00:16:01.404 --> 00:16:03.544
See how many rich people...

264
00:16:03.544 --> 00:16:05.174
married ordinary people.

265
00:16:05.505 --> 00:16:06.575
Is it limited to the business world?

266
00:16:07.014 --> 00:16:08.274
It's also the same in the politics world.

267
00:16:08.274 --> 00:16:09.914
They marry each other.

268
00:16:09.914 --> 00:16:11.985
That's how they increase their power.

269
00:16:12.184 --> 00:16:13.514
You're right.

270
00:16:15.184 --> 00:16:16.884
Ji An was wise.

271
00:16:17.424 --> 00:16:18.884
She knew what was coming.

272
00:16:19.825 --> 00:16:22.154
By the way, why do you look...

273
00:16:22.225 --> 00:16:23.995
even more serious than Ji An?

274
00:16:24.365 --> 00:16:25.965
Am I right?

275
00:16:32.264 --> 00:16:33.875
Why are there so many?

276
00:16:33.875 --> 00:16:35.875
I researched everything...

277
00:16:35.875 --> 00:16:37.304
about waste wood and pellets.

278
00:16:38.274 --> 00:16:40.274
For industrial use, for power generation,

279
00:16:40.274 --> 00:16:42.345
for household use, and for pets.

280
00:16:43.144 --> 00:16:44.914
I never knew it could be used for pets too.

281
00:16:48.355 --> 00:16:49.784
- Welcome home, sir. - Thank you.

282
00:16:50.585 --> 00:16:52.755
- Where is Ms. Min? - It's her day off.

283
00:16:53.255 --> 00:16:54.455
I see.

284
00:16:55.894 --> 00:16:57.365
You're back home.

285
00:16:58.195 --> 00:16:59.195
Yes.

286
00:16:59.764 --> 00:17:01.835
Why are you wearing an apron?

287
00:17:02.064 --> 00:17:03.604
I was making rabokki.

288
00:17:03.604 --> 00:17:04.935
Do you want some too?

289
00:17:05.435 --> 00:17:08.274
Of course. I like rabokki.

290
00:17:15.145 --> 00:17:17.485
I don't know how it would taste.

291
00:17:18.284 --> 00:17:21.314
It seems like you put a lot of things.

292
00:17:25.124 --> 00:17:26.425
It's delicious, Ji Soo.

293
00:17:26.624 --> 00:17:27.895
You cook well too.

294
00:17:27.895 --> 00:17:29.294
No, I don't.

295
00:17:29.294 --> 00:17:31.594
I never cooked at home.

296
00:17:31.594 --> 00:17:33.064
Ji An always did it.

297
00:17:35.495 --> 00:17:38.905
And this is my brother's recipe.

298
00:17:39.635 --> 00:17:41.935
I wanted to cook for you before I leave,

299
00:17:42.005 --> 00:17:44.175
but this was all I knew how to cook.

300
00:17:45.245 --> 00:17:46.274
Before you leave?

301
00:17:48.975 --> 00:17:51.344
I am going abroad to study.

302
00:17:51.385 --> 00:17:52.685
I'm leaving the day after tomorrow.

303
00:17:53.885 --> 00:17:54.915
What?

304
00:17:55.014 --> 00:17:56.985
You're leaving the day after tomorrow?

305
00:17:57.425 --> 00:18:00.624
Yes. I am going to France.

306
00:18:01.354 --> 00:18:03.094
Ji Soo.

307
00:18:03.094 --> 00:18:04.725
What's this smell?

308
00:18:06.024 --> 00:18:07.965
Mother, is Ji Soo going abroad?

309
00:18:09.435 --> 00:18:10.705
You're home early.

310
00:18:10.705 --> 00:18:12.604
I was going to tell you anyway.

311
00:18:22.245 --> 00:18:24.544
She was supposed to go study abroad.

312
00:18:24.844 --> 00:18:26.255
But it's too soon.

313
00:18:26.955 --> 00:18:28.385
Besides, she continued working at the bakery...

314
00:18:28.385 --> 00:18:29.584
even after coming here.

315
00:18:30.155 --> 00:18:32.524
How can she agree to go study abroad?

316
00:18:33.054 --> 00:18:35.655
Did you threaten her?

317
00:18:35.655 --> 00:18:37.864
I told her to go, and she agreed.

318
00:18:38.465 --> 00:18:40.965
Ask Ji Soo if you can't trust me.

319
00:18:43.304 --> 00:18:45.005
How can you suddenly go abroad in two days?

320
00:18:45.005 --> 00:18:46.274
What happened?

321
00:18:47.334 --> 00:18:49.544
I am going because I have to.

322
00:18:50.874 --> 00:18:52.245
By any chance,

323
00:18:52.774 --> 00:18:54.574
did Mother find out about that man?

324
00:18:57.344 --> 00:18:58.344
She did, didn't she?

325
00:19:00.054 --> 00:19:01.155
If it weren't for a guy problem,

326
00:19:01.155 --> 00:19:03.255
she wouldn't push you into leaving like this.

327
00:19:06.824 --> 00:19:09.624
But you weren't dating him.

328
00:19:09.624 --> 00:19:10.624
Right?

329
00:19:10.624 --> 00:19:12.665
You were talking about forgetting him.

330
00:19:15.294 --> 00:19:16.534
Were you dating him?

331
00:19:21.635 --> 00:19:23.475
What happened?

332
00:19:29.044 --> 00:19:30.685
I'm back, ma'am.

333
00:19:33.415 --> 00:19:35.155
I thought you were coming back tomorrow.

334
00:19:35.455 --> 00:19:37.054
I had to bring this.

335
00:19:37.455 --> 00:19:39.925
I hurried to give you this.

336
00:19:40.155 --> 00:19:42.995
I found out where Ji An and Do Kyung are.

337
00:19:43.965 --> 00:19:45.495
You're late.

338
00:19:45.725 --> 00:19:47.235
Father already found them.

339
00:19:48.895 --> 00:19:50.665
While Father's people were finding the place,

340
00:19:51.005 --> 00:19:53.104
what did your people do?

341
00:19:53.874 --> 00:19:55.205
I am sorry, ma'am.

342
00:19:59.715 --> 00:20:03.344
How did Father find out?

343
00:20:05.685 --> 00:20:06.784
I wonder.

344
00:20:12.485 --> 00:20:13.554
Ji Soo.

345
00:20:14.554 --> 00:20:16.495
If you don't want to go abroad, you don't have to.

346
00:20:16.925 --> 00:20:18.594
You don't have to force yourself.

347
00:20:18.965 --> 00:20:21.635
No, I want to go.

348
00:20:22.294 --> 00:20:23.735
You want to go?

349
00:20:25.005 --> 00:20:28.405
I have no reason to stay in Korea now.

350
00:20:29.435 --> 00:20:31.304
Anyway, I have to be a person...

351
00:20:31.304 --> 00:20:32.604
who fits in the family.

352
00:20:33.715 --> 00:20:35.675
But it's all so sudden.

353
00:20:36.645 --> 00:20:37.645
By any chance,

354
00:20:38.185 --> 00:20:40.155
did your mom scold you?

355
00:20:41.114 --> 00:20:42.114
Or...

356
00:20:42.685 --> 00:20:44.955
did she say something that worries you?

357
00:20:46.324 --> 00:20:48.524
I hope you will tell me the real reason.

358
00:20:50.064 --> 00:20:52.425
I am sorry to you.

359
00:20:53.264 --> 00:20:55.435
I know that you are a very nice person.

360
00:20:58.205 --> 00:21:01.034
You said you missed me for a long time.

361
00:21:02.945 --> 00:21:05.074
But I'm not sure if you missed me...

362
00:21:05.804 --> 00:21:08.774
or if you missed the girl named Eun Seok.

363
00:21:09.885 --> 00:21:11.784
What are you talking about?

364
00:21:13.255 --> 00:21:14.784
I think there is...

365
00:21:15.554 --> 00:21:18.284
an image of Eun Seok...

366
00:21:19.185 --> 00:21:21.255
this family wants.

367
00:21:21.594 --> 00:21:23.195
It's neither me nor Ji An.

368
00:21:24.324 --> 00:21:26.695
That's not true. You are Eun Seok.

369
00:21:29.665 --> 00:21:31.334
We've been apart for many years.

370
00:21:33.405 --> 00:21:34.405
Right.

371
00:21:34.975 --> 00:21:37.574
We can't become a family overnight.

372
00:22:06.104 --> 00:22:07.905
Denmark uses a million tons,

373
00:22:07.905 --> 00:22:09.405
and Germany uses 70,000 tons.

374
00:22:10.145 --> 00:22:12.205
In Korea, most houses don't use pellets...

375
00:22:12.205 --> 00:22:13.774
for their small boilers.

376
00:22:14.715 --> 00:22:16.314
It doesn't seem to have much chance, does it?

377
00:22:17.014 --> 00:22:18.715
And some companies are already selling them.

378
00:22:18.844 --> 00:22:21.255
Then search about pet bedding wood.

379
00:22:21.455 --> 00:22:22.455
Okay.

380
00:22:37.834 --> 00:22:41.205
(2018 Unelma Design Contest, Seo Ji An)

381
00:23:16.104 --> 00:23:18.445
(Contacts, Ji Ho)

382
00:23:18.874 --> 00:23:20.415
"You heard from Ji An, right?"

383
00:23:20.874 --> 00:23:22.675
"I lost 5,000 dollars."

384
00:23:22.675 --> 00:23:24.385
"I should've listened to you."

385
00:23:26.455 --> 00:23:28.084
(Ji Tae)

386
00:23:28.084 --> 00:23:29.755
"It's going to be very cold tonight."

387
00:23:29.955 --> 00:23:32.225
"You should leave the heater on."

388
00:23:33.354 --> 00:23:34.524
(Ji An)

389
00:23:34.524 --> 00:23:37.594
"Dad, I made the three-layer drawer."

390
00:23:37.624 --> 00:23:39.895
"Put books on top and use it as a bookshelf.

391
00:23:41.334 --> 00:23:43.564
(Ji Ho)

392
00:23:46.334 --> 00:23:48.774
"Dad, I tried selling on the streets today."

393
00:23:48.935 --> 00:23:50.705
"My practice was successful."

394
00:23:58.544 --> 00:23:59.955
What will you do today?

395
00:24:00.514 --> 00:24:02.985
Today will be my last day at the bakery.

396
00:24:04.584 --> 00:24:07.255
And I will spend the night at my parents' house.

397
00:24:08.554 --> 00:24:09.564
What?

398
00:24:09.864 --> 00:24:12.124
When I come back after three years,

399
00:24:12.225 --> 00:24:14.534
I will be Choi Eun Seok then.

400
00:24:15.294 --> 00:24:17.834
Today is my last day as Seo Ji Soo.

401
00:24:18.264 --> 00:24:20.104
So I want to spend my last day...

402
00:24:20.475 --> 00:24:23.245
at the house I lived as Ji Soo.

403
00:24:27.215 --> 00:24:29.685
Okay. You should do that.

404
00:24:30.945 --> 00:24:32.314
Thank you.

405
00:24:33.354 --> 00:24:36.485
I will eat breakfast here tomorrow.

406
00:24:47.534 --> 00:24:49.564
I am going to the woodworking studio.

407
00:24:49.564 --> 00:24:50.905
Ji An is going to make me earrings.

408
00:24:53.905 --> 00:24:55.635
She always liked wood.

409
00:25:11.824 --> 00:25:13.395
Not knowing that it was actually you,

410
00:25:14.594 --> 00:25:17.665
I shook off your hand and left you.

411
00:25:19.594 --> 00:25:20.665
But...

412
00:25:21.435 --> 00:25:22.635
it turned out it wasn't me.

413
00:25:23.635 --> 00:25:25.005
Do you think it was easy to accept that?

414
00:25:25.935 --> 00:25:27.374
You're not some stranger.

415
00:25:28.175 --> 00:25:30.774
Do you know how shameful I felt to see you?

416
00:25:32.505 --> 00:25:35.314
You were so desperate to study abroad,

417
00:25:36.314 --> 00:25:37.915
but I am the one who's going abroad.

418
00:25:39.584 --> 00:25:41.114
I am sorry, Ji An.

419
00:25:42.284 --> 00:25:43.624
Take care.

420
00:26:07.975 --> 00:26:10.014
I wondered if it was you, and it is you.

421
00:26:11.514 --> 00:26:13.814
Did you come to see me?

422
00:26:14.155 --> 00:26:16.685
No. I am on my way to the bakery.

423
00:26:19.854 --> 00:26:21.794
I heard from Hyuk.

424
00:26:23.024 --> 00:26:24.294
It must be really tough for you.

425
00:26:25.024 --> 00:26:26.995
I was going to call you today anyway.

426
00:26:27.564 --> 00:26:30.905
No. Don't call me. I am okay.

427
00:26:32.304 --> 00:26:33.735
How can you be okay?

428
00:26:34.505 --> 00:26:35.935
Let's meet after work.

429
00:26:36.604 --> 00:26:37.945
I have an appointment.

430
00:26:38.505 --> 00:26:39.645
I see.

431
00:26:40.175 --> 00:26:41.675
Then when will you have time?

432
00:26:42.215 --> 00:26:43.844
Make time for me, Ji Soo.

433
00:26:44.314 --> 00:26:45.784
I have something to tell you.

434
00:26:47.784 --> 00:26:48.985
It's too late.

435
00:26:50.284 --> 00:26:51.324
What?

436
00:26:52.725 --> 00:26:54.395
I am late for work.

437
00:26:57.195 --> 00:26:58.195
Take care.

438
00:26:59.225 --> 00:27:00.235
And stay healthy.

439
00:27:03.435 --> 00:27:06.534
What's wrong? It's as if you're leaving.

440
00:27:08.135 --> 00:27:09.405
It's nothing.

441
00:27:10.304 --> 00:27:11.675
As I see things after everything has passed,

442
00:27:11.675 --> 00:27:12.705
everything seems funny.

443
00:27:14.175 --> 00:27:18.084
I wanted everything to be sorted out by itself.

444
00:27:20.755 --> 00:27:23.425
I have to go. Bye.

445
00:27:37.064 --> 00:27:38.764
She doesn't look good.

446
00:27:41.175 --> 00:27:42.675
Did she come to see Hyuk?

447
00:27:47.014 --> 00:27:48.975
- Yes, Nam Goo. - Hyuk.

448
00:27:50.114 --> 00:27:52.284
I couldn't decide whether I should tell you this.

449
00:27:52.715 --> 00:27:55.014
But I can't stop thinking about Ji Soo...

450
00:27:55.755 --> 00:27:58.155
who ran like crazy to tell me...

451
00:27:58.155 --> 00:27:59.385
that Hee was leaving.

452
00:28:00.725 --> 00:28:01.995
What are you talking about?

453
00:28:02.255 --> 00:28:03.725
Can you talk in a way that I can understand?

454
00:28:05.864 --> 00:28:08.564
Ji Soo is quitting the bakery.

455
00:28:09.635 --> 00:28:11.005
Today is her last day.

456
00:28:11.104 --> 00:28:12.905
Ji Soo is quitting the bakery?

457
00:28:16.745 --> 00:28:18.844
- Ji Soo. - Yes?

458
00:28:18.945 --> 00:28:21.245
Go to the cafe across the street.

459
00:28:21.675 --> 00:28:22.985
Hyuk is waiting.

460
00:28:30.225 --> 00:28:31.824
Why are you quitting the bakery?

461
00:28:32.425 --> 00:28:34.054
You don't have to do that because of me.

462
00:28:34.794 --> 00:28:36.195
It's not because of you.

463
00:28:36.624 --> 00:28:39.195
Then why are you quitting so suddenly?

464
00:28:40.135 --> 00:28:41.334
Have you forgotten?

465
00:28:41.635 --> 00:28:43.364
My family owns Haesung Corporation.

466
00:28:44.165 --> 00:28:45.264
Did you think...

467
00:28:45.264 --> 00:28:46.774
I'd keep working in that small bakery?

468
00:28:49.544 --> 00:28:52.574
They let me work while I was adjusting.

469
00:28:53.215 --> 00:28:55.145
I think it's about time.

470
00:28:55.445 --> 00:28:56.715
That's why I decided to quit.

471
00:28:57.014 --> 00:28:59.314
But I know how much you like Nam Goo's bread...

472
00:28:59.485 --> 00:29:01.685
and how much you wanted to learn to bake.

473
00:29:01.685 --> 00:29:03.985
Yes. I had fun.

474
00:29:04.485 --> 00:29:06.425
But this is not the only place I can be.

475
00:29:07.054 --> 00:29:09.425
I can learn from a famous patissier.

476
00:29:10.094 --> 00:29:11.524
Or I could open a bakery.

477
00:29:13.895 --> 00:29:15.064
Do you mean this?

478
00:29:16.064 --> 00:29:18.834
I realized you were right.

479
00:29:19.935 --> 00:29:22.104
I'm glad you found out before it got serious.

480
00:29:23.604 --> 00:29:25.774
Now, I decided to live as a member of Haesung.

481
00:29:27.074 --> 00:29:28.145
You sound...

482
00:29:30.385 --> 00:29:31.784
so indifferent.

483
00:29:33.084 --> 00:29:34.854
You sound as if this is nothing.

484
00:29:40.854 --> 00:29:42.895
You should've accepted me a little earlier.

485
00:29:44.725 --> 00:29:46.635
Then we could've at least dated a little more.

486
00:29:48.364 --> 00:29:49.534
It's too late.

487
00:30:57.965 --> 00:30:59.005
Excuse me.

488
00:31:01.435 --> 00:31:02.975
Hello.

489
00:31:02.975 --> 00:31:04.344
What are you doing here?

490
00:31:04.675 --> 00:31:07.544
Well, it's raining now.

491
00:31:07.645 --> 00:31:08.675
Pardon?

492
00:31:09.014 --> 00:31:11.485
I just didn't want the wood to get wet.

493
00:31:13.054 --> 00:31:14.385
This is treated wood.

494
00:31:14.385 --> 00:31:15.814
It's okay to get wet.

495
00:31:15.955 --> 00:31:17.255
It's flooring for a terrace.

496
00:31:18.955 --> 00:31:20.324
I didn't know that.

497
00:31:21.794 --> 00:31:23.324
Thank you anyway.

498
00:31:31.804 --> 00:31:33.735
Just leave it as it is. I'll take care of it.

499
00:31:33.735 --> 00:31:36.445
No, I did this. I should clean it up.

500
00:31:37.574 --> 00:31:39.675
You're not going to keep the newspaper, are you?

501
00:31:40.014 --> 00:31:42.014
What? Do you need this?

502
00:31:42.014 --> 00:31:43.014
No.

503
00:31:48.614 --> 00:31:49.925
Don't you have an umbrella?

504
00:31:50.524 --> 00:31:51.854
I... I have one.

505
00:31:54.124 --> 00:31:55.695
What is she doing here without an umbrella?

506
00:32:14.719 --> 00:32:19.719
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E41 My Golden Life "I'm Going to Study Abroad"</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

507
00:32:28.225 --> 00:32:29.255
Take this.

508
00:32:37.405 --> 00:32:38.905
So it was that umbrella.

509
00:32:43.044 --> 00:32:44.175
Hyuk.

510
00:32:46.915 --> 00:32:48.574
What are you doing here in the rain?

511
00:33:01.995 --> 00:33:02.995
Drink some of this.

512
00:33:05.725 --> 00:33:07.564
What were you doing in the rain?

513
00:33:08.935 --> 00:33:09.935
Hee.

514
00:33:11.435 --> 00:33:12.905
It's about Ji Soo.

515
00:33:14.334 --> 00:33:16.005
I see.

516
00:33:17.005 --> 00:33:19.104
I heard you broke up with her.

517
00:33:19.675 --> 00:33:20.814
I used to think...

518
00:33:22.885 --> 00:33:25.185
she was silly and foolish.

519
00:33:26.854 --> 00:33:28.554
She covered treated wood with newspaper...

520
00:33:28.554 --> 00:33:30.124
so it doesn't get wet.

521
00:33:33.124 --> 00:33:34.455
I didn't know back then.

522
00:33:35.624 --> 00:33:37.094
Why she did that.

523
00:33:42.495 --> 00:33:43.764
That's who she was.

524
00:33:50.005 --> 00:33:51.774
But I didn't know that for such a long time.

525
00:34:25.744 --> 00:34:27.374
Why did you not get a taxi today?

526
00:34:27.644 --> 00:34:29.885
I'm working late. I should go back after dinner.

527
00:34:30.914 --> 00:34:32.515
Then why were you waiting for me?

528
00:34:33.454 --> 00:34:34.885
Let's talk over dinner.

529
00:34:35.155 --> 00:34:36.425
I have something to tell you.

530
00:34:37.684 --> 00:34:38.925
Imaginary cancer?

531
00:34:40.195 --> 00:34:42.825
Yes. Is it funny?

532
00:34:43.425 --> 00:34:46.265
It's not funny. Why would you say that?

533
00:34:46.965 --> 00:34:49.235
People might feel that way.

534
00:34:50.235 --> 00:34:51.765
It's a ridiculous illusion.

535
00:34:52.465 --> 00:34:53.505
Isn't it?

536
00:34:54.834 --> 00:34:56.744
He must've been very stressed out.

537
00:34:57.175 --> 00:34:58.175
It made him get sick.

538
00:34:58.945 --> 00:35:01.374
It's not that I'm trying to push you or something.

539
00:35:03.945 --> 00:35:05.885
Going through all this,

540
00:35:06.854 --> 00:35:08.485
I realized something again.

541
00:35:10.425 --> 00:35:12.285
I'm his oldest son after all.

542
00:35:13.954 --> 00:35:15.454
I felt so bad for him.

543
00:35:18.765 --> 00:35:19.994
I understand.

544
00:35:21.434 --> 00:35:23.035
On the other hand, I thought...

545
00:35:24.235 --> 00:35:25.564
it might be better for you...

546
00:35:26.274 --> 00:35:28.505
to live alone free and easy...

547
00:35:28.575 --> 00:35:30.505
as you've always wanted to.

548
00:35:31.774 --> 00:35:33.274
You only live once.

549
00:35:36.744 --> 00:35:38.285
And I guess it's time...

550
00:35:39.215 --> 00:35:42.215
to tell my parents about us.

551
00:35:44.155 --> 00:35:47.794
So I want you to make your position clear now.

552
00:35:49.894 --> 00:35:52.294
Are you talking about our divorce?

553
00:35:54.535 --> 00:35:55.564
Yes.

554
00:36:01.474 --> 00:36:03.374
Tell them we're getting a divorce.

555
00:36:05.305 --> 00:36:07.274
I'll divorce you only after our baby gets born.

556
00:36:09.274 --> 00:36:10.744
Seo Ji Tae.

557
00:36:11.615 --> 00:36:13.814
So are you going to wait for me every night?

558
00:36:14.985 --> 00:36:17.755
What if I take a day off and go to a doctor?

559
00:36:17.885 --> 00:36:19.854
Then you can't divorce me.

560
00:36:21.195 --> 00:36:22.925
You're to blame for our divorce.

561
00:36:23.394 --> 00:36:25.095
You won't have the right to sue for divorce.

562
00:36:33.305 --> 00:36:34.505
Okay.

563
00:36:36.905 --> 00:36:38.405
I'll give birth to the baby.

564
00:36:39.874 --> 00:36:40.945
Then we will divorce.

565
00:36:44.215 --> 00:36:47.584
By any chance, don't expect me...

566
00:36:48.515 --> 00:36:51.954
to change my mind after having the baby.

567
00:36:55.255 --> 00:36:58.024
I'm trying not to expect it.

568
00:37:02.064 --> 00:37:03.965
You might be right about this.

569
00:37:06.934 --> 00:37:08.905
It might be better to listen to you.

570
00:37:09.974 --> 00:37:11.005
But...

571
00:37:12.604 --> 00:37:14.474
I just can't do this.

572
00:37:18.615 --> 00:37:20.385
I'm sorry, Soo A.

573
00:37:21.954 --> 00:37:24.854
I get that. So stop waiting for me after work.

574
00:37:26.294 --> 00:37:28.994
Tell your parents about us as you want.

575
00:37:30.325 --> 00:37:32.825
I can stay with Seung Hun.

576
00:37:34.265 --> 00:37:35.334
I should get going then.

577
00:37:52.314 --> 00:37:58.655
(People who love classical guitars)

578
00:38:12.104 --> 00:38:14.274
(Seoul to Jeongseon)

579
00:38:30.524 --> 00:38:32.325
(Ji Soo)

580
00:38:36.195 --> 00:38:38.095
Hello, Ji Soo.

581
00:38:38.265 --> 00:38:39.425
Dad.

582
00:38:39.765 --> 00:38:42.064
I'm going to your house later tonight.

583
00:38:42.365 --> 00:38:44.204
To my house?

584
00:39:00.954 --> 00:39:03.224
Ji An will be moving out tomorrow.

585
00:39:22.834 --> 00:39:24.845
- Ji An. - Yes, come in.

586
00:39:33.454 --> 00:39:34.914
You can use this and return it later.

587
00:39:35.215 --> 00:39:36.985
I'll drive you home after work tomorrow.

588
00:39:37.684 --> 00:39:38.684
Will you do that?

589
00:39:40.095 --> 00:39:42.255
I owe you so much even until my last moment.

590
00:39:43.064 --> 00:39:44.894
Make sure not to leave your stuff here.

591
00:39:45.265 --> 00:39:46.265
Okay.

592
00:39:52.135 --> 00:39:53.135
Gosh.

593
00:39:53.774 --> 00:39:56.075
What are you doing here?

594
00:39:56.974 --> 00:39:58.945
I was just doing some thinking.

595
00:40:00.274 --> 00:40:02.144
Are you throwing it out? Give me that.

596
00:40:02.144 --> 00:40:03.184
No, it's okay.

597
00:40:14.994 --> 00:40:16.994
I should go to a factory early in the morning,

598
00:40:17.365 --> 00:40:18.664
so I won't be able to see you out.

599
00:40:19.834 --> 00:40:20.865
Okay.

600
00:40:21.794 --> 00:40:23.934
You found a factory already?

601
00:40:26.604 --> 00:40:28.204
If you run into me on the streets,

602
00:40:28.204 --> 00:40:29.505
you must at least say hello.

603
00:40:31.474 --> 00:40:33.845
Of course I will. We're not enemies or something.

604
00:40:48.294 --> 00:40:50.524
Have you been well?

605
00:40:52.325 --> 00:40:54.635
Yes. Welcome back.

606
00:40:56.805 --> 00:40:58.334
Nothing has changed.

607
00:41:00.805 --> 00:41:02.704
Sit down. Let's sit. Come here.

608
00:41:13.615 --> 00:41:14.755
How...

609
00:41:15.954 --> 00:41:17.285
Why are you here?

610
00:41:18.325 --> 00:41:20.524
I'm going to study abroad.

611
00:41:21.695 --> 00:41:23.365
So I came to say goodbye.

612
00:41:24.195 --> 00:41:25.465
- "Study abroad"? - "Study abroad"?

613
00:41:27.235 --> 00:41:28.794
I'm going to France.

614
00:41:30.635 --> 00:41:32.735
You... You're going to study abroad?

615
00:41:33.405 --> 00:41:34.834
In France?

616
00:41:35.575 --> 00:41:37.244
How? You're so timid.

617
00:41:41.374 --> 00:41:44.044
They offered to make me a patissier.

618
00:41:46.755 --> 00:41:48.084
When will you leave then?

619
00:41:50.724 --> 00:41:51.724
Soon.

620
00:41:56.965 --> 00:41:59.394
Dad, why do you look so poorly?

621
00:42:01.334 --> 00:42:03.204
I... I don't look too bad.

622
00:42:03.564 --> 00:42:05.334
It's just my old age.

623
00:42:06.735 --> 00:42:08.774
Why have you lost weight?

624
00:42:09.544 --> 00:42:10.575
Me?

625
00:42:11.575 --> 00:42:13.644
I'm trying to lose weight.

626
00:42:15.974 --> 00:42:16.985
So...

627
00:42:17.684 --> 00:42:18.785
Ji Soo...

628
00:42:18.885 --> 00:42:20.985
I'm not here to talk about the past.

629
00:42:21.414 --> 00:42:22.854
I don't want to do that.

630
00:42:23.584 --> 00:42:27.695
I just want to sleep with you tonight.

631
00:42:28.124 --> 00:42:29.255
For one last time.

632
00:42:29.865 --> 00:42:31.524
You... You'll sleep with us?

633
00:42:33.365 --> 00:42:34.394
Yes.

634
00:42:59.285 --> 00:43:02.965
We got you a tutor. Why won't your grades go up?

635
00:43:02.965 --> 00:43:05.294
You might never go to college.

636
00:43:05.595 --> 00:43:07.365
I tried, but I'm no good.

637
00:43:07.465 --> 00:43:09.965
And do I have to go to college?

638
00:43:10.164 --> 00:43:12.405
What? Of course you must.

639
00:43:12.465 --> 00:43:14.405
You'll find a nice husband only then.

640
00:43:14.974 --> 00:43:17.445
My goodness. Will you stop it already?

641
00:43:17.805 --> 00:43:20.874
Stop what? See her report card for yourself.

642
00:43:21.345 --> 00:43:23.414
Grades aren't everything.

643
00:43:23.544 --> 00:43:26.115
Why do you keep stressing her out?

644
00:43:26.115 --> 00:43:28.414
If everyone comes first, who would come last?

645
00:43:28.814 --> 00:43:30.184
He's right.

646
00:43:30.385 --> 00:43:33.994
But why does my daughter have to come last?

647
00:43:34.124 --> 00:43:36.825
Mom, I'm not last in my class.

648
00:43:37.465 --> 00:43:39.224
That's not what I mean.

649
00:43:39.465 --> 00:43:42.595
I'm saying that everyone has their place.

650
00:43:42.865 --> 00:43:46.905
Ji Soo's sweet and naive, so people will adore her.

651
00:43:46.974 --> 00:43:49.474
She makes everyone feel good.

652
00:43:49.974 --> 00:43:53.874
She needs to go to college to become something.

653
00:43:53.874 --> 00:43:56.615
Come on. She doesn't like to study...

654
00:43:56.615 --> 00:43:58.385
because she hasn't found what she wants to do yet.

655
00:43:58.515 --> 00:44:01.115
Once she does, she'll study even if we stop her.

656
00:44:01.215 --> 00:44:02.954
- Right? - Yes.

657
00:44:03.055 --> 00:44:04.524
- You're the best. - Come here.

658
00:44:04.655 --> 00:44:06.724
- Come here. - I love you, Dad.

659
00:44:09.224 --> 00:44:10.925
- I love you. - Sweetie pie.

660
00:44:14.994 --> 00:44:16.865
Now that I think about it,

661
00:44:18.834 --> 00:44:21.104
it's only natural for you...

662
00:44:21.434 --> 00:44:22.805
to favor your own.

663
00:44:28.874 --> 00:44:30.485
But still,

664
00:44:32.684 --> 00:44:34.715
for as long as I lived with you,

665
00:44:37.124 --> 00:44:38.954
you never let me think...

666
00:44:40.555 --> 00:44:44.124
I was not your own flesh and blood.

667
00:44:47.365 --> 00:44:48.695
Thank you.

668
00:44:58.244 --> 00:45:00.075
It's not that, Ji Soo.

669
00:45:02.044 --> 00:45:03.715
It really isn't.

670
00:45:06.715 --> 00:45:08.485
When your mother came,

671
00:45:09.684 --> 00:45:11.285
I was so scared...

672
00:45:13.655 --> 00:45:15.255
that I'd lose my girls.

673
00:45:16.425 --> 00:45:18.524
Both you and Ji An.

674
00:45:18.994 --> 00:45:21.035
I didn't want to send either of you.

675
00:45:29.075 --> 00:45:30.704
But she screamed at me...

676
00:45:31.805 --> 00:45:34.274
and demanded to tell her who her daughter was.

677
00:45:38.544 --> 00:45:40.885
I thought of Ji An, who'd been to...

678
00:45:42.184 --> 00:45:43.524
the police station...

679
00:45:43.524 --> 00:45:45.624
for fighting a privileged friend.

680
00:45:48.494 --> 00:45:51.224
You'd lived with us without any complaints.

681
00:45:53.365 --> 00:45:54.994
You'd been happy.

682
00:46:02.575 --> 00:46:06.144
Who was it? Who did this to you?

683
00:46:06.144 --> 00:46:07.314
Be quiet.

684
00:46:09.584 --> 00:46:11.314
You might not believe me,

685
00:46:12.644 --> 00:46:13.985
but that's how I felt.

686
00:46:15.814 --> 00:46:18.524
I never thought you were not my own.

687
00:46:18.524 --> 00:46:20.724
How could I discriminate you two?

688
00:46:25.294 --> 00:46:26.894
But I'm still sorry, Ji Soo.

689
00:46:31.005 --> 00:46:32.505
I'm so sorry.

690
00:46:36.644 --> 00:46:37.945
I see...

691
00:46:40.945 --> 00:46:41.974
Mom.

692
00:48:25.885 --> 00:48:29.524
I'm meeting the chairman, so I can't see you off.

693
00:48:30.655 --> 00:48:31.655
Okay.

694
00:48:33.155 --> 00:48:34.595
Goodbye.

695
00:48:35.724 --> 00:48:37.095
I'll visit you soon.

696
00:48:38.925 --> 00:48:40.334
I wish you...

697
00:48:42.265 --> 00:48:43.604
good health.

698
00:48:47.274 --> 00:48:49.175
We'll build MJ Resorts in...

699
00:48:49.644 --> 00:48:52.274
Spain, Italy, and Germany simultaneously.

700
00:48:52.945 --> 00:48:54.874
Before the deals to secure the land...

701
00:48:55.244 --> 00:48:57.615
go awry, let me go over and sign the papers.

702
00:48:57.684 --> 00:48:59.314
If Haesung Apparel's president went over...

703
00:48:59.314 --> 00:49:01.814
while the chief director's on leave,

704
00:49:02.354 --> 00:49:04.985
rumors will spread immediately...

705
00:49:04.985 --> 00:49:06.854
about Do Kyung having problems.

706
00:49:07.794 --> 00:49:11.064
Then how long must we wait for him?

707
00:49:11.164 --> 00:49:12.794
There are other bids...

708
00:49:12.794 --> 00:49:14.334
for the plots in Berlin and Valencia.

709
00:49:14.334 --> 00:49:15.334
Send your wife.

710
00:49:15.934 --> 00:49:17.434
Until Do Kyung's return,

711
00:49:17.965 --> 00:49:19.334
make it look like a holiday.

712
00:49:19.934 --> 00:49:22.575
I can't send Jin Hee on her own.

713
00:49:23.175 --> 00:49:25.974
Sir, you must put the company first.

714
00:49:34.755 --> 00:49:37.385
Then did my earrings come through?

715
00:49:37.825 --> 00:49:39.794
So I'm treating you to say thanks.

716
00:49:41.354 --> 00:49:42.794
And to ask for another favor.

717
00:49:42.894 --> 00:49:43.925
Another one?

718
00:49:44.325 --> 00:49:47.394
The customers went crazy over the freebies.

719
00:49:48.394 --> 00:49:50.104
Wasn't it Seo Hyun's clothes?

720
00:49:50.204 --> 00:49:53.635
No, even the clothes I got at Dongdaemun sold well.

721
00:49:55.235 --> 00:49:58.644
Don't spend too much time with Seo Hyun.

722
00:49:59.175 --> 00:50:00.974
You could get Ji Soo in trouble.

723
00:50:01.144 --> 00:50:02.175
Ji Soo?

724
00:50:02.845 --> 00:50:07.414
No, she's doing just fine as the rebellious outlaw.

725
00:50:07.615 --> 00:50:09.755
- "The rebellious outlaw"? - Yes.

726
00:50:09.825 --> 00:50:12.124
No way, not with her personality.

727
00:50:12.524 --> 00:50:16.494
Her family's not the type that will let her do that.

728
00:50:16.494 --> 00:50:19.195
Ji Soo fights back when she's upset.

729
00:50:19.425 --> 00:50:20.965
I bet she did that.

730
00:50:20.965 --> 00:50:23.405
Was it the company anniversary event?

731
00:50:23.604 --> 00:50:25.164
She ran away from it.

732
00:50:25.164 --> 00:50:27.405
She ran away from the anniversary event?

733
00:50:27.405 --> 00:50:30.274
Yes. She retaliated and won her freedom.

734
00:50:31.675 --> 00:50:34.115
She's dating and living life just fine.

735
00:50:36.184 --> 00:50:39.854
Why did she run away from the ceremony?

736
00:50:42.584 --> 00:50:45.354
They wouldn't let her work at the bakery after that.

737
00:50:47.024 --> 00:50:48.354
Why are you mumbling?

738
00:50:48.425 --> 00:50:49.454
Ji Ho.

739
00:50:49.454 --> 00:50:51.564
Check on Ji Soo on your way back.

740
00:50:53.635 --> 00:50:54.664
Okay.

741
00:51:04.805 --> 00:51:05.805
What?

742
00:51:06.215 --> 00:51:07.274
"What?"

743
00:51:08.244 --> 00:51:11.115
Hey, you wanted to come clothes shopping with me.

744
00:51:11.445 --> 00:51:13.255
Oh, that was today.

745
00:51:13.785 --> 00:51:14.985
I can't go today.

746
00:51:14.985 --> 00:51:17.084
My mom might come back home...

747
00:51:17.084 --> 00:51:18.825
after taking Ji Soo to the airport.

748
00:51:19.325 --> 00:51:20.695
Is Ji Soo going somewhere?

749
00:51:20.954 --> 00:51:22.124
Is she going on a trip?

750
00:51:22.494 --> 00:51:23.595
You didn't know?

751
00:51:24.095 --> 00:51:25.865
She's going abroad today to study.

752
00:51:26.434 --> 00:51:28.894
She's going abroad to study? Why?

753
00:51:29.434 --> 00:51:32.235
Miss, when you arrive at the airport,

754
00:51:32.235 --> 00:51:34.535
you'll be given a phone to use there.

755
00:51:34.974 --> 00:51:37.345
Give me the one you used until now.

756
00:51:38.044 --> 00:51:39.274
What... What for?

757
00:51:41.314 --> 00:51:43.215
You must get used to your surroundings.

758
00:51:43.215 --> 00:51:44.845
It's best to forget about Korea.

759
00:51:46.015 --> 00:51:47.755
Give her your phone.

760
00:51:50.184 --> 00:51:51.224
Okay.

761
00:51:57.095 --> 00:51:58.124
Let's go.

762
00:51:59.465 --> 00:52:02.095
Ji Soo, take care.

763
00:52:02.965 --> 00:52:05.204
I'll visit with Mom to do some shopping.

764
00:52:05.465 --> 00:52:07.874
Okay. Take care.

765
00:52:22.814 --> 00:52:26.024
(Ji An)

766
00:52:32.524 --> 00:52:33.965
(Dad)

767
00:52:34.564 --> 00:52:37.564
Dad... Dad, why did you call?

768
00:52:37.564 --> 00:52:40.905
Ji An, have you heard from Ji Soo?

769
00:52:41.805 --> 00:52:43.075
Why?

770
00:52:43.945 --> 00:52:45.305
Is something wrong?

771
00:52:45.575 --> 00:52:49.845
She said she's going to France to study...

772
00:52:50.515 --> 00:52:51.914
and spent last night with us.

773
00:52:52.814 --> 00:52:53.814
What?

774
00:52:54.385 --> 00:52:55.914
Ji Soo's going...

775
00:52:56.854 --> 00:52:58.825
Why would she go so suddenly?

776
00:52:58.825 --> 00:53:01.555
She just said she's going.

777
00:53:01.894 --> 00:53:05.224
But I feel strange like something isn't right.

778
00:53:05.624 --> 00:53:09.334
She's too scared to even go traveling with friends.

779
00:53:09.664 --> 00:53:12.905
And she's saying she'll go to France on her own.

780
00:53:13.934 --> 00:53:17.405
Dad, I'll find out and call you back.

781
00:53:19.974 --> 00:53:21.445
(Ji Ho)

782
00:53:22.175 --> 00:53:23.885
Hey, Ji Ho.

783
00:53:26.454 --> 00:53:28.615
Ji An, Ji Soo's going abroad to study.

784
00:53:29.885 --> 00:53:32.325
I know, I just heard.

785
00:53:32.894 --> 00:53:33.925
She's really going?

786
00:53:33.925 --> 00:53:36.664
Yes. I'm at the bakery, but she quit yesterday.

787
00:53:37.064 --> 00:53:39.735
And Seo Hyun said she was caught dating.

788
00:53:40.635 --> 00:53:41.664
What?

789
00:53:43.434 --> 00:53:44.664
Take care.

790
00:53:45.434 --> 00:53:46.704
And stay healthy.

791
00:53:48.905 --> 00:53:50.575
She must've been threatened.

792
00:53:50.805 --> 00:53:53.244
She's being sent away. What should we do?

793
00:54:05.285 --> 00:54:06.394
(Bouillabaisse and ciabatta)

794
00:54:06.394 --> 00:54:07.755
(Feta cheese spread and focaccia sandwich)

795
00:54:07.755 --> 00:54:11.425
That's why I'm happiest in a bakery.

796
00:54:12.494 --> 00:54:14.164
My family owns Haesung Corporation.

797
00:54:14.564 --> 00:54:15.735
Did you think...

798
00:54:15.735 --> 00:54:17.204
I'd keep working in that small bakery?

799
00:54:21.735 --> 00:54:24.474
Yu Mi, can you send me this month's sales report?

800
00:54:24.474 --> 00:54:25.505
Sure.

801
00:54:31.914 --> 00:54:34.555
I hope you date someone...

802
00:54:34.615 --> 00:54:36.885
you can get to know over a long time.

803
00:54:37.385 --> 00:54:38.655
Goodbye forever.

804
00:54:39.354 --> 00:54:41.055
What's Bread Pitt saying?

805
00:54:41.724 --> 00:54:43.724
Why would a guy say "goodbye forever"?

806
00:54:45.465 --> 00:54:48.235
I want you to know who I am.

807
00:54:48.235 --> 00:54:50.334
I want you to recognize me.

808
00:54:50.334 --> 00:54:52.405
I want to get to know you.

809
00:54:53.635 --> 00:54:55.575
You should've accepted me a little earlier.

810
00:54:57.474 --> 00:54:59.544
Then we could've at least dated a little more.

811
00:55:01.075 --> 00:55:02.274
It's too late.

812
00:55:04.985 --> 00:55:06.115
Was it you?

813
00:55:11.925 --> 00:55:13.755
(Ji Soo)

814
00:55:16.195 --> 00:55:18.564
The phone is turned off.

815
00:55:24.365 --> 00:55:25.365
Ji An.

816
00:55:25.434 --> 00:55:28.374
Hyuk, help me. I need your help.

817
00:55:28.805 --> 00:55:30.945
- What is it? - It's Ji Soo.

818
00:55:31.505 --> 00:55:33.345
She's going abroad today.

819
00:55:33.345 --> 00:55:35.244
But I think she was forced.

820
00:55:35.544 --> 00:55:36.544
What?

821
00:55:37.744 --> 00:55:40.215
You'll really focus on pellets for pets?

822
00:55:40.515 --> 00:55:43.385
That business size suits my reality and situation.

823
00:55:43.385 --> 00:55:45.555
But it must be completely environmentally-friendly.

824
00:55:45.785 --> 00:55:48.224
We can cut costs by using wood shavings.

825
00:55:49.454 --> 00:55:51.265
You've finally broken your old habits.

826
00:55:53.994 --> 00:55:55.164
(Seo Ji An)

827
00:55:56.465 --> 00:55:58.934
- Hello? - Do Kyung, help me.

828
00:55:59.005 --> 00:56:00.604
What is it? Tell me.

829
00:56:00.604 --> 00:56:02.075
Where are you now?

830
00:56:02.075 --> 00:56:03.144
A cafe in Hongdae.

831
00:56:03.144 --> 00:56:04.675
That's great.

832
00:56:04.675 --> 00:56:06.575
Then can you head to the airport...

833
00:56:06.575 --> 00:56:07.575
and call me back?

834
00:56:07.644 --> 00:56:09.015
What's wrong?

835
00:56:11.385 --> 00:56:13.314
- Your car keys. - What's wrong?

836
00:56:13.314 --> 00:56:14.814
I don't know, Ji An asked for help.

837
00:56:25.024 --> 00:56:26.095
Hello?

838
00:56:26.095 --> 00:56:28.394
Seo Hyun, it's Seo Ji An.

839
00:56:28.434 --> 00:56:30.035
Seo Ji An? Who's...

840
00:56:30.865 --> 00:56:32.064
Eun Seok?

841
00:56:32.334 --> 00:56:33.834
When did Ji Soo leave?

842
00:56:33.905 --> 00:56:34.905
No, what time is her flight?

843
00:56:34.905 --> 00:56:36.374
Where in France is she headed?

844
00:56:37.575 --> 00:56:39.175
I... I don't know.

845
00:56:39.175 --> 00:56:41.414
I only said goodbye when she left.

846
00:56:43.215 --> 00:56:44.684
If you don't tell me,

847
00:56:44.684 --> 00:56:46.414
I'll tell your mother...

848
00:56:46.414 --> 00:56:47.785
that you're hanging out with Ji Ho.

849
00:56:53.555 --> 00:56:54.894
Ms. No's with her.

850
00:56:54.894 --> 00:56:56.794
The driver won't go over 80km per hour.

851
00:56:56.794 --> 00:56:58.024
If they left an hour ago,

852
00:56:58.024 --> 00:57:00.135
They could be on the airport highway now.

853
00:57:00.135 --> 00:57:01.365
That's why we must hurry.

854
00:57:01.365 --> 00:57:03.104
See you there.

855
00:57:09.945 --> 00:57:11.774
Ji Soo's going to the airport.

856
00:57:11.774 --> 00:57:13.374
She's being forced to go study abroad.

857
00:57:13.474 --> 00:57:16.215
"Study abroad"? Why would she be forced?

858
00:57:17.084 --> 00:57:19.244
What'll you do if she's being forced?

859
00:57:19.885 --> 00:57:21.155
I won't let that happen.

860
00:57:40.235 --> 00:57:41.235
Hey.

861
00:57:44.474 --> 00:57:46.314
- Do Kyung. - Ji An.

862
00:57:49.015 --> 00:57:50.345
Why is he here?

863
00:57:50.485 --> 00:57:52.015
I'll explain later.

864
00:57:52.015 --> 00:57:54.055
Ms. No's with Ms. Min.

865
00:57:54.115 --> 00:57:55.115
When you see Ms. No's car,

866
00:57:55.115 --> 00:57:56.584
you two can flank her.

867
00:57:56.584 --> 00:57:58.124
Oh, you take the right,

868
00:57:58.124 --> 00:57:59.624
and I'll get in front.

869
00:57:59.624 --> 00:58:01.224
You'll block their way?

870
00:58:01.325 --> 00:58:03.925
Yes, to stop her from going after Hyuk.

871
00:58:03.925 --> 00:58:06.024
Why shouldn't she chase his car?

872
00:58:06.024 --> 00:58:07.765
I'll explain over the phone.

873
00:58:07.765 --> 00:58:09.934
- Let's go. Come on, Hyuk. - Okay.

874
00:58:13.905 --> 00:58:16.345
Why did he tag along?

875
00:58:37.394 --> 00:58:38.994
Why is this so slow?

876
00:58:38.994 --> 00:58:41.164
Go faster, will you?

877
00:58:42.934 --> 00:58:44.235
(Ji An)

878
00:58:45.564 --> 00:58:46.575
Hi, Ji An.

879
00:58:46.575 --> 00:58:48.774
Ji Soo was dating Hyuk.

880
00:58:49.334 --> 00:58:50.374
What?

881
00:58:50.374 --> 00:58:51.874
It looks like...

882
00:58:51.874 --> 00:58:54.414
your mom found that out and scared Ji Soo.

883
00:58:54.644 --> 00:58:56.314
Mom threatened Ji Soo?

884
00:58:57.385 --> 00:58:58.914
What did she say?

885
00:58:59.414 --> 00:59:02.414
Ji Soo told Seo Hyun she had to go.

886
00:59:03.655 --> 00:59:06.755
That if she didn't, many would get hurt.

887
00:59:07.925 --> 00:59:09.664
Didn't she mishear her?

888
00:59:10.294 --> 00:59:12.325
Mom wouldn't say something like that.

889
00:59:18.564 --> 00:59:20.274
Don't be too scared.

890
00:59:20.274 --> 00:59:22.635
People manage to live wherever they are.

891
00:59:24.874 --> 00:59:26.005
Sure.

892
00:59:28.115 --> 00:59:30.644
You've never been abroad for your entire life.

893
00:59:32.044 --> 00:59:33.515
When Do Kyung comes home,

894
00:59:33.515 --> 00:59:36.385
I'll come and visit with your dad and Seo Hyun.

895
00:59:40.724 --> 00:59:42.624
Can I make one call?

896
00:59:43.494 --> 00:59:45.695
I didn't say goodbye to Do Kyung.

897
00:59:45.865 --> 00:59:48.235
Can you call him and put me on?

898
00:59:49.635 --> 00:59:50.834
Are you sure?

899
00:59:52.405 --> 00:59:53.604
Okay, then.

900
00:59:54.934 --> 00:59:56.845
(Mother)

901
01:00:00.374 --> 01:00:01.374
Mom.

902
01:00:01.575 --> 01:00:03.885
Do Kyung, it's Ji Soo.

903
01:00:04.215 --> 01:00:05.345
Yes, Ji Soo.

904
01:00:06.285 --> 01:00:09.184
I'm headed to the airport to study abroad.

905
01:00:09.524 --> 01:00:11.755
I called to say goodbye.

906
01:00:12.084 --> 01:00:13.294
Where are you now?

907
01:00:13.294 --> 01:00:15.124
Don't say anything else.

908
01:00:15.294 --> 01:00:17.195
Look outside, and tell me how far away...

909
01:00:17.195 --> 01:00:18.325
the airport is.

910
01:00:18.624 --> 01:00:21.434
No. Just answer. 10km? 15km?

911
01:00:22.394 --> 01:00:24.365
I don't know about that.

912
01:00:26.805 --> 01:00:28.905
Thanks for the movie date.

913
01:00:30.544 --> 01:00:31.575
What?

914
01:00:31.644 --> 01:00:33.845
And I'm sorry for not catching on sooner.

915
01:00:34.575 --> 01:00:36.544
I'm slow like that.

916
01:00:38.544 --> 01:00:41.655
If I'd known you were the one drying seaweed,

917
01:00:42.155 --> 01:00:44.155
I wouldn't have been so mean.

918
01:00:45.954 --> 01:00:47.595
I'm sorry I didn't know.

919
01:00:48.224 --> 01:00:50.695
I'm sorry I didn't know why you came.

920
01:00:51.624 --> 01:00:52.695
Ji Soo.

921
01:00:52.894 --> 01:00:53.994
Ji Soo.

922
01:00:53.994 --> 01:00:55.394
And I love you.

923
01:00:56.664 --> 01:00:58.965
Please say that to Ji An.

924
01:01:01.405 --> 01:01:02.704
- What are you doing? - Ji Soo.

925
01:01:02.704 --> 01:01:03.874
Mother.

926
01:01:20.195 --> 01:01:21.925
Ji Soo just called me.

927
01:01:22.124 --> 01:01:23.394
I don't think they're at the airport yet.

928
01:01:23.994 --> 01:01:26.664
That's a relief. What did she say?

929
01:01:27.334 --> 01:01:28.434
I'll tell you later.

930
01:01:29.064 --> 01:01:30.564
But when did they start dating?

931
01:01:31.164 --> 01:01:32.765
Is Ji Soo dating that guy?

932
01:01:33.874 --> 01:01:35.334
He's just a player.

933
01:01:38.075 --> 01:01:39.445
What are you doing? Hurry up.

934
01:01:40.075 --> 01:01:41.244
Hurry up.

935
01:01:46.314 --> 01:01:47.715
Gosh. Seriously.

936
01:01:54.325 --> 01:01:57.825
I'll settle down fast so I can help you.

937
01:01:58.595 --> 01:01:59.794
So don't worry, and just wait.

938
01:02:02.465 --> 01:02:03.965
Don't worry, and just wait.

939
01:02:09.135 --> 01:02:10.144
I've...

940
01:02:11.005 --> 01:02:13.175
heard about that family.

941
01:02:14.244 --> 01:02:16.015
And I've heard about the life of rich people...

942
01:02:16.744 --> 01:02:19.985
and how they raise their children.

943
01:02:21.914 --> 01:02:22.985
I...

944
01:02:24.325 --> 01:02:25.825
don't want to date like that.

945
01:02:33.865 --> 01:02:36.765
As I see things after everything has passed,

946
01:02:36.765 --> 01:02:37.805
everything seems funny.

947
01:02:38.465 --> 01:02:41.934
I wanted everything to be sorted out by itself.

948
01:02:55.655 --> 01:02:57.624
Ji An. I see Mother's car in front.

949
01:02:57.624 --> 01:02:58.854
Okay.

950
01:03:01.624 --> 01:03:02.624
Did you find it?

951
01:03:02.624 --> 01:03:05.265
Yes. Do you see the white car ahead?

952
01:03:05.265 --> 01:03:06.294
It's that car.

953
01:03:29.255 --> 01:03:30.385
General Manager Min.

954
01:03:31.224 --> 01:03:32.485
We have a suspicious tail.

955
01:03:34.724 --> 01:03:37.765
Ms. No. That's the Woodworking Studio truck.

956
01:03:38.294 --> 01:03:39.294
What?

957
01:03:39.425 --> 01:03:40.894
All the other lanes are empty.

958
01:03:41.765 --> 01:03:43.434
I think it's following us.

959
01:03:49.675 --> 01:03:51.374
Mr. Lee. Speed up.

960
01:03:51.644 --> 01:03:53.774
General Manager Min. Call the police.

961
01:03:54.015 --> 01:03:55.044
Yes.

962
01:04:24.005 --> 01:04:26.615
What are they trying to do? Why are they...

963
01:04:48.664 --> 01:04:49.805
Quickly move the car.

964
01:05:03.945 --> 01:05:05.084
Lock the door.

965
01:05:08.515 --> 01:05:09.524
Ji Soo.

966
01:05:12.684 --> 01:05:13.724
Ji Soo.

967
01:05:17.564 --> 01:05:18.765
No, Seo Ji Soo.

968
01:05:19.425 --> 01:05:20.465
Ji Soo.

969
01:05:21.035 --> 01:05:22.035
Let's go.

970
01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:16.960
(My Golden Life)

971
01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:20.329
I hope you let Ji Soo live the way she wants.

972
01:06:20.329 --> 01:06:22.800
Get out! Was Do Kyung not enough for you...

973
01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:24.469
to try and order my daughter's life too?

974
01:06:24.469 --> 01:06:25.900
My sister's boyfriend?

975
01:06:26.269 --> 01:06:27.440
No way.

976
01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:28.840
I'm already her boyfriend.

977
01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:31.309
They're pretty tangled up.

978
01:06:31.309 --> 01:06:33.880
Seo Ji An's not easy.

979
01:06:34.179 --> 01:06:36.079
Father will drag Do Kyung home.

980
01:06:36.079 --> 01:06:37.619
I'll drag Ji Soo home.

981
01:06:37.619 --> 01:06:39.249
You can't bring Ji Soo by force.

982
01:06:39.249 --> 01:06:41.219
I will never let that happen.

983
01:06:41.249 --> 01:06:42.820
Let me be your brother just for today.

984
01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:44.219
I'll walk you home like a brother.

985
01:06:44.219 --> 01:06:46.659
You can't smile brightly in front of me.

986
01:06:46.659 --> 01:06:48.760
So I'm never going to stop you.
