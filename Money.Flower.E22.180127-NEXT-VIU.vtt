00:00:10.026 --> 00:00:11.196
(Episode 22)

2
00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:23.846
(Authentic Deed of Will)

3
00:00:25.115 --> 00:00:26.815
This is Chairman Jang Boo Cheon's notarized certificate...

4
00:00:27.216 --> 00:00:29.486
stating that he will donate all of his fortune...

5
00:00:29.646 --> 00:00:31.086
to Cheong A after his death.

6
00:00:32.255 --> 00:00:33.556
This arrived today by express mail service.

7
00:00:33.586 --> 00:00:35.855
I opened it to put it away as I thought it was just a document.

8
00:00:36.086 --> 00:00:37.355
This is a false document.

9
00:00:38.495 --> 00:00:39.595
Is Boo Cheon...

10
00:00:40.995 --> 00:00:42.065
at home now?

11
00:00:42.065 --> 00:00:43.395
He hasn't come home yet.

12
00:00:54.845 --> 00:00:58.046
(Pil Joo)

13
00:01:02.215 --> 00:01:03.315
Yes?

14
00:01:07.256 --> 00:01:08.385
Pil Joo.

15
00:01:26.405 --> 00:01:28.306
Jang Boo Cheon's last known location...

16
00:01:28.306 --> 00:01:30.476
is the intersection near our studio in Insa-dong.

17
00:01:31.416 --> 00:01:34.015
I can't locate him further because his phone is turned off now.

18
00:01:37.816 --> 00:01:39.015
Insa-dong?

19
00:02:08.786 --> 00:02:12.316
(Will, Testator: Jang Boo Cheon)

20
00:02:54.696 --> 00:02:55.726
Boo Cheon.

21
00:02:56.666 --> 00:02:57.795
Boo Cheon!

22
00:03:31.666 --> 00:03:34.536
We are treating him with high concentration of oxygen.

23
00:03:34.536 --> 00:03:36.066
His life isn't in danger.

24
00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:39.276
However, we must observe him longer regarding his recovery.

25
00:03:39.276 --> 00:03:42.776
He wouldn't have made it if he was even a second late.

26
00:04:04.295 --> 00:04:05.865
(Intensive Care Unit)

27
00:04:07.605 --> 00:04:08.666
Yes, Yong Goo.

28
00:04:09.406 --> 00:04:11.476
I found Jang Boo Cheon's phone in his car.

29
00:04:12.205 --> 00:04:14.976
You sent a text message asking him to meet you at the studio.

30
00:04:15.446 --> 00:04:16.745
I never sent it.

31
00:04:18.716 --> 00:04:22.016
Someone made it look like you did and lured Jang Boo Cheon in.

32
00:04:22.445 --> 00:04:23.985
If Jang Boo Cheon had died,

33
00:04:24.055 --> 00:04:25.985
you would've taken the fall for it.

34
00:04:26.115 --> 00:04:28.826
Find out what happened.

35
00:04:29.485 --> 00:04:32.096
And check every surveillance camera near the studio.

36
00:04:32.625 --> 00:04:34.865
Get me the license plate numbers for suspicious vehicles.

37
00:04:36.065 --> 00:04:37.966
According to my source who watched the scene,

38
00:04:38.065 --> 00:04:39.836
Kang Pil Joo showed up...

39
00:04:39.836 --> 00:04:42.666
and rescued Jang Boo Cheon which caused the operation to fail.

40
00:05:05.826 --> 00:05:07.026
Thank you, Attorney Kang.

41
00:05:07.925 --> 00:05:11.166
He would've been in critical condition if you were late.

42
00:05:12.666 --> 00:05:14.565
The worst is over now,

43
00:05:15.505 --> 00:05:17.065
but he's still in a coma.

44
00:05:18.776 --> 00:05:20.976
He might have difficulty in breathing or stop breathing,

45
00:05:21.005 --> 00:05:22.875
so we have to observe him for the time being.

46
00:05:25.416 --> 00:05:26.416
Mom.

47
00:05:27.076 --> 00:05:28.846
I have to go for my shift.

48
00:05:31.916 --> 00:05:32.985
Thank you for your help.

49
00:05:41.396 --> 00:05:42.565
Why did Boo Cheon...

50
00:05:43.295 --> 00:05:44.695
go to the studio?

51
00:05:46.995 --> 00:05:48.166
Someone...

52
00:05:49.105 --> 00:05:51.336
made it look like I sent him a text message...

53
00:05:52.235 --> 00:05:53.276
and...

54
00:05:54.206 --> 00:05:55.605
lured him into the studio.

55
00:05:59.916 --> 00:06:00.985
Father...

56
00:06:09.555 --> 00:06:10.826
It was Father.

57
00:06:25.935 --> 00:06:26.935
Why...

58
00:06:28.875 --> 00:06:30.406
did you rescue...

59
00:06:31.146 --> 00:06:32.416
and take care of Boo Cheon...

60
00:06:33.416 --> 00:06:34.815
whom you must hate?

61
00:06:34.815 --> 00:06:36.615
I never hated him for a second.

62
00:06:38.286 --> 00:06:40.315
I've pitied him many times though.

63
00:06:42.726 --> 00:06:44.096
He was born...

64
00:06:44.826 --> 00:06:46.526
as a son of someone like you.

65
00:06:49.195 --> 00:06:50.266
How pitiful.

66
00:06:53.036 --> 00:06:54.036
Boo Cheon...

67
00:06:55.266 --> 00:06:57.605
never wanted to become the chairman...

68
00:06:58.375 --> 00:07:00.105
to begin with.

69
00:07:01.105 --> 00:07:02.305
I'm sure you remember that.

70
00:07:03.776 --> 00:07:06.076
You helped Boo Cheon become the chairman.

71
00:07:06.945 --> 00:07:07.945
I...

72
00:07:08.786 --> 00:07:10.886
neither had the time nor felt the need...

73
00:07:12.615 --> 00:07:14.026
to think about Boo Cheon.

74
00:07:15.286 --> 00:07:16.526
My target...

75
00:07:17.555 --> 00:07:18.995
was you, Executive Jung.

76
00:07:22.565 --> 00:07:24.036
To take your revenge,

77
00:07:25.336 --> 00:07:27.206
you victimized Boo Cheon.

78
00:07:28.706 --> 00:07:31.076
Because of your sin which you had committed,

79
00:07:33.305 --> 00:07:34.976
Boo Cheon became the victim.

80
00:07:47.586 --> 00:07:50.286
Executive Jung, I will stay here.

81
00:07:50.526 --> 00:07:51.755
Please go home and rest.

82
00:07:53.226 --> 00:07:54.565
I will stay here,

83
00:07:56.966 --> 00:07:58.466
so no one pulls off the respirator.

84
00:07:59.266 --> 00:08:00.336
I must keep watch.

85
00:08:21.386 --> 00:08:23.386
Pil Joo, I found the arsonist.

86
00:08:23.656 --> 00:08:26.855
The instigator is Jang Kook Hwan's old driver.

87
00:08:50.815 --> 00:08:52.455
This is the phone they cloned.

88
00:08:55.955 --> 00:08:57.126
This is Jang Boo Cheon's.

89
00:08:59.595 --> 00:09:00.626
And...

90
00:09:01.366 --> 00:09:02.896
this is the confession video.

91
00:09:09.935 --> 00:09:11.835
- Well done. - Pil Joo.

92
00:09:13.705 --> 00:09:15.146
Just forget about everything...

93
00:09:16.006 --> 00:09:17.045
and leave.

94
00:09:18.575 --> 00:09:21.185
He even tried to murder a grandson he lived with for 37 years.

95
00:09:21.585 --> 00:09:23.715
Even if Jang Boo Cheon isn't related, how could he do this?

96
00:09:23.986 --> 00:09:25.055
Everyone is insane.

97
00:09:25.856 --> 00:09:28.925
He will try to kill you too in the end.

98
00:09:29.626 --> 00:09:31.325
Jang Boo Cheon is lying on the hospital bed.

99
00:09:32.156 --> 00:09:35.266
Jung Mal Ran can't do anything without you.

100
00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:36.896
You have...

101
00:09:38.166 --> 00:09:39.565
done enough.

102
00:09:41.205 --> 00:09:42.565
Let's stop now, Pil Joo.

103
00:09:43.536 --> 00:09:45.376
My work isn't finished yet.

104
00:09:50.616 --> 00:09:52.646
I knew that you wouldn't listen to me,

105
00:09:54.085 --> 00:09:55.386
but I was just frustrated.

106
00:10:00.685 --> 00:10:01.756
If...

107
00:10:03.856 --> 00:10:05.626
something bad happens to you no matter how small it may be,

108
00:10:07.055 --> 00:10:08.065
I'm going to...

109
00:10:08.866 --> 00:10:10.835
burn down Mooshimwon that day.

110
00:10:11.965 --> 00:10:14.435
I wanted to do it when you got into the car accident,

111
00:10:14.906 --> 00:10:17.276
but since your recovery was more important,

112
00:10:18.236 --> 00:10:19.305
I held myself back.

113
00:10:30.516 --> 00:10:33.715
This is Boo Cheon's will you drew up, sir.

114
00:11:04.156 --> 00:11:06.815
(Jang Boo Cheon)

115
00:11:19.736 --> 00:11:20.736
You wanted to...

116
00:11:21.666 --> 00:11:23.876
get rid of two problems at once.

117
00:11:24.705 --> 00:11:26.935
Make Jang Boo Cheon die in fire...

118
00:11:27.376 --> 00:11:29.776
and send Kang Pil Joo to prison...

119
00:11:29.945 --> 00:11:31.045
for the murder.

120
00:11:32.945 --> 00:11:35.616
Your plan has failed, sir.

121
00:11:39.685 --> 00:11:40.725
Sir,

122
00:11:41.656 --> 00:11:42.925
didn't I tell you...

123
00:11:43.156 --> 00:11:46.156
I will get rid of Boo Cheon and Executive Jung?

124
00:11:46.695 --> 00:11:50.695
I only told you that Boo Cheon wasn't a Jang...

125
00:11:51.636 --> 00:11:54.835
because I wanted you to help me when I bring Boo Cheon down...

126
00:11:55.305 --> 00:11:57.205
from his chairman post.

127
00:12:00.406 --> 00:12:01.705
Boo Cheon and Executive Jung...

128
00:12:03.106 --> 00:12:04.916
are my preys I've put a lot of time...

129
00:12:05.116 --> 00:12:06.646
and effort into for a long time.

130
00:12:07.246 --> 00:12:10.085
Don't ever touch them again.

131
00:12:10.715 --> 00:12:13.786
I let them slide for two decades.

132
00:12:14.256 --> 00:12:15.585
I will punish them...

133
00:12:16.786 --> 00:12:18.225
however I see fit.

134
00:12:18.996 --> 00:12:20.695
Is only your revenge important?

135
00:12:21.595 --> 00:12:23.026
What about...

136
00:12:23.225 --> 00:12:25.636
the humiliation that Soo Man and I felt?

137
00:12:25.766 --> 00:12:27.305
You already punished him.

138
00:12:27.506 --> 00:12:29.036
Boo Cheon has already...

139
00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:31.205
died in that fire.

140
00:12:32.776 --> 00:12:33.805
Had I not found him,

141
00:12:34.545 --> 00:12:36.776
he'd have been dead already.

142
00:12:39.475 --> 00:12:42.416
If you plan to reinstate President Jang Seong Man...

143
00:12:43.185 --> 00:12:45.756
or promote Yeo Cheon to the chairman post,

144
00:12:46.685 --> 00:12:48.026
I advise you to give up now.

145
00:12:50.325 --> 00:12:52.725
"Due to Chairman Jang Boo Cheon's hard effort..."

146
00:12:53.156 --> 00:12:55.065
"to grow Cheong A Bio,"

147
00:12:55.526 --> 00:12:58.965
"he has been swamped with heavy workload which weakened his health."

148
00:12:59.396 --> 00:13:02.965
"Therefore, he will give up his chairmanship temporarily."

149
00:13:03.236 --> 00:13:04.736
"I will appoint..."

150
00:13:05.106 --> 00:13:07.246
"Director Kang Pil Joo whom I believe..."

151
00:13:08.305 --> 00:13:10.045
" to be competent..."

152
00:13:10.445 --> 00:13:13.516
"and whom I've seen for 20 years to the managerial executive post."

153
00:13:14.085 --> 00:13:16.815
"As the biggest shareholder of Cheong A, the honorary chairman,"

154
00:13:17.116 --> 00:13:20.116
"I'd like everyone to accept my arbitrary decision."

155
00:13:20.685 --> 00:13:23.486
"I advise the board of directors..."

156
00:13:23.795 --> 00:13:25.455
"to vote..."

157
00:13:25.756 --> 00:13:27.095
"regarding accepting Kang Pil Joo."

158
00:13:28.766 --> 00:13:30.835
I'd like you to make this announcement.

159
00:13:30.866 --> 00:13:32.935
You should try begging instead.

160
00:13:33.935 --> 00:13:36.766
Beg me to accept you as a Jang and make you the chairman.

161
00:13:37.006 --> 00:13:40.175
I don't want to become the chairman as a Jang.

162
00:13:40.575 --> 00:13:43.175
- What? - I will become the chairman...

163
00:13:43.246 --> 00:13:46.075
as Kang Pil Joo whose first job was Cheong A...

164
00:13:46.376 --> 00:13:49.016
and who only worked for Cheong A...

165
00:13:49.185 --> 00:13:50.516
without getting distracted.

166
00:13:50.715 --> 00:13:53.756
You're getting on my nerves, you ungrateful lowlife.

167
00:13:53.786 --> 00:13:54.955
Chairmanship of Cheong A.

168
00:13:55.886 --> 00:13:58.996
If Vice President Jang Soo Man hadn't passed away,

169
00:13:59.455 --> 00:14:01.465
I'd naturally have had a chance to become the chairman.

170
00:14:01.795 --> 00:14:04.496
How could a son born out of wedlock have a chance at the chairmanship?

171
00:14:04.496 --> 00:14:07.166
It is true that among your grandsons,

172
00:14:07.166 --> 00:14:09.666
I, Jang Eun Cheon, am the most qualified, isn't it?

173
00:14:10.606 --> 00:14:12.536
You've watched me for 20 years.

174
00:14:13.406 --> 00:14:15.305
You cannot deny the fact.

175
00:14:16.475 --> 00:14:19.075
You're finally revealing your true intentions.

176
00:14:19.876 --> 00:14:21.786
Your greed to take over Cheong A.

177
00:14:22.085 --> 00:14:23.646
I can't give you a lot of time.

178
00:14:24.386 --> 00:14:28.055
After I add the attempted murder of your own grandson onto the list...

179
00:14:28.185 --> 00:14:30.225
of illegal activities you did...

180
00:14:30.425 --> 00:14:32.156
and cases on which...

181
00:14:33.425 --> 00:14:35.866
you manipulated the law, I'll wait then.

182
00:14:59.486 --> 00:15:00.585
Attorney Kang.

183
00:15:00.925 --> 00:15:03.925
I didn't drag your father to the wedding.

184
00:15:04.195 --> 00:15:07.595
Your father couldn't give up Cheong A's money.

185
00:15:07.896 --> 00:15:09.126
Of course.

186
00:15:09.626 --> 00:15:11.736
It was too big to refuse.

187
00:15:13.166 --> 00:15:15.666
Aren't you after Cheong A's money as well?

188
00:15:15.835 --> 00:15:19.506
You're going to take the money in the name of revenge.

189
00:15:20.006 --> 00:15:22.106
Be honest, Attorney Kang.

190
00:16:37.256 --> 00:16:38.256
Boo Cheon.

191
00:16:40.856 --> 00:16:41.986
Boo Cheon.

192
00:16:44.925 --> 00:16:46.996
You have to be a chairman's friend now.

193
00:16:50.636 --> 00:16:52.496
When you and Executive Jung...

194
00:16:53.036 --> 00:16:54.435
leave here voluntarily,

195
00:16:56.205 --> 00:16:58.975
I was going to take that place.

196
00:17:04.775 --> 00:17:06.745
But I can't wait...

197
00:17:15.826 --> 00:17:17.455
until you wake up.

198
00:17:19.025 --> 00:17:20.056
Pil Joo.

199
00:17:21.166 --> 00:17:22.765
Mom told me...

200
00:17:24.195 --> 00:17:27.035
that you want to become a lawyer to help me become the chairman.

201
00:17:29.106 --> 00:17:30.336
You don't need to do that.

202
00:17:30.806 --> 00:17:32.136
Quit law school...

203
00:17:32.705 --> 00:17:34.245
and study what you want.

204
00:17:35.745 --> 00:17:36.775
There's no such thing.

205
00:17:36.806 --> 00:17:37.945
Why not?

206
00:17:38.215 --> 00:17:40.916
You said you wanted to study forest and trees.

207
00:17:44.056 --> 00:17:45.116
You know what?

208
00:17:45.685 --> 00:17:47.056
My father...

209
00:17:48.185 --> 00:17:49.785
was a professor who studied forest and trees...

210
00:17:49.785 --> 00:17:51.896
that you want to study,

211
00:17:53.896 --> 00:17:56.195
but Grandfather made him quit,

212
00:17:56.596 --> 00:17:57.965
so he can inherit Cheong A.

213
00:17:59.636 --> 00:18:01.066
When you live in Cheong A,

214
00:18:02.306 --> 00:18:04.035
you have to give up what you want to do.

215
00:18:04.935 --> 00:18:06.336
When Yeo Cheon was young,

216
00:18:06.906 --> 00:18:09.505
he wanted to be a toy block maker.

217
00:18:11.175 --> 00:18:13.576
My uncle beat him with a baseball bat...

218
00:18:14.015 --> 00:18:16.146
for playing with toy blocks...

219
00:18:16.715 --> 00:18:18.386
and threw them out.

220
00:18:21.826 --> 00:18:23.425
What did you want to be?

221
00:18:24.896 --> 00:18:26.156
I just...

222
00:18:26.556 --> 00:18:28.425
want to enjoy my life with my father's fortune...

223
00:18:28.866 --> 00:18:31.666
and have fun with pretty girls.

224
00:18:34.306 --> 00:18:35.606
Don't tell this to anyone.

225
00:18:39.906 --> 00:18:41.146
A pianist.

226
00:18:42.705 --> 00:18:43.705
Do you...

227
00:18:44.275 --> 00:18:45.945
know how to play the piano?

228
00:18:46.945 --> 00:18:47.945
Very...

229
00:18:49.685 --> 00:18:50.685
well.

230
00:18:52.556 --> 00:18:53.785
I gave up...

231
00:18:53.985 --> 00:18:56.056
after seeing my mom in despair...

232
00:18:58.556 --> 00:19:00.356
when I said I wanted to major in piano...

233
00:19:01.096 --> 00:19:02.195
in middle school.

234
00:19:05.435 --> 00:19:07.666
My mom threw the piano out the next day.

235
00:19:36.725 --> 00:19:39.596
Congressman Na's family wants to see me urgently.

236
00:19:40.035 --> 00:19:42.265
If you're busy, I'll go alone.

237
00:19:43.106 --> 00:19:44.306
If you go alone,

238
00:19:45.235 --> 00:19:47.775
you might reveal where he is.

239
00:19:48.906 --> 00:19:50.675
I'll accompany you.

240
00:20:20.175 --> 00:20:21.306
Mo Hyun.

241
00:20:56.646 --> 00:20:57.816
Congressman Na.

242
00:20:59.275 --> 00:21:00.346
Attorney Kang.

243
00:21:17.596 --> 00:21:19.735
When my father's fully recovered,

244
00:21:19.935 --> 00:21:21.465
I'm going to suggest him to turn himself in.

245
00:21:25.306 --> 00:21:27.175
You must squeeze the bad pus out...

246
00:21:27.275 --> 00:21:29.076
to have new skin.

247
00:21:29.406 --> 00:21:30.715
He...

248
00:21:31.245 --> 00:21:33.346
might not want that.

249
00:21:34.386 --> 00:21:35.546
Father...

250
00:21:39.856 --> 00:21:42.185
said he's truly sorry.

251
00:21:46.525 --> 00:21:48.525
I didn't accept it then.

252
00:21:51.066 --> 00:21:52.765
If he's still the same,

253
00:21:53.296 --> 00:21:55.435
he'll reveal the truth.

254
00:21:58.306 --> 00:21:59.336
Then...

255
00:22:02.675 --> 00:22:04.245
the arrow of the truth...

256
00:22:04.745 --> 00:22:06.646
will point at you too.

257
00:22:09.015 --> 00:22:10.346
I have something...

258
00:22:10.785 --> 00:22:12.255
to return to him.

259
00:22:14.185 --> 00:22:17.455
It's the recording file that was in his cell phone.

260
00:22:19.126 --> 00:22:22.096
He'll probably look for it.

261
00:22:24.935 --> 00:22:26.066
I will...

262
00:22:26.965 --> 00:22:28.235
bring it to the Foundation office...

263
00:22:28.836 --> 00:22:29.906
later.

264
00:22:30.475 --> 00:22:31.636
You're going to...

265
00:22:32.035 --> 00:22:34.146
make Grandfather draw back from management?

266
00:22:34.306 --> 00:22:35.505
We didn't...

267
00:22:36.546 --> 00:22:38.846
earn this chance with our ability.

268
00:22:40.945 --> 00:22:44.816
This is like a seed war.

269
00:22:46.656 --> 00:22:48.925
Other people except us are crossbreeds...

270
00:22:49.886 --> 00:22:52.556
so that we, the purebred, have earned the premium.

271
00:22:55.566 --> 00:22:58.366
If we follow what Grandfather wants,

272
00:22:58.995 --> 00:23:01.265
he'll abandon us again later.

273
00:23:04.136 --> 00:23:06.035
He was...

274
00:23:07.646 --> 00:23:08.906
in the front-line management...

275
00:23:08.906 --> 00:23:11.416
for Cheong A.

276
00:23:13.116 --> 00:23:15.015
But that's what holds back Cheong A.

277
00:23:16.715 --> 00:23:19.856
We should've taken him to the rear earlier.

278
00:23:22.025 --> 00:23:25.396
That's why I established a strategic alliance with your aunt.

279
00:23:25.725 --> 00:23:28.225
For her and Boo Cheon's stocks. Especially...

280
00:23:28.896 --> 00:23:30.566
the Bio holding company stocks.

281
00:23:31.035 --> 00:23:32.136
Yes.

282
00:23:32.566 --> 00:23:33.906
It's true...

283
00:23:34.535 --> 00:23:36.505
that you and I have been lazy...

284
00:23:36.666 --> 00:23:38.775
on getting stocks because we underestimated Bio.

285
00:23:38.775 --> 00:23:40.846
Let's stop looking back at ourselves.

286
00:23:41.146 --> 00:23:42.846
We need to advance.

287
00:23:43.916 --> 00:23:46.076
It's past Aunt's appointment.

288
00:23:46.745 --> 00:23:48.586
We need to make them wait.

289
00:23:48.985 --> 00:23:50.245
That way...

290
00:23:50.715 --> 00:23:53.685
she would not forget that I have six...

291
00:23:53.685 --> 00:23:55.086
and she has four.

292
00:24:26.356 --> 00:24:29.086
Mal Ran.

293
00:24:29.086 --> 00:24:31.326
I was busy today.

294
00:24:31.495 --> 00:24:32.725
You know...

295
00:24:33.925 --> 00:24:36.965
that Boo Cheon's not my husband's son, right?

296
00:24:36.995 --> 00:24:38.136
Mal Ran.

297
00:24:38.735 --> 00:24:41.066
You're so confident...

298
00:24:41.806 --> 00:24:43.636
as if you've won a gold medal.

299
00:24:46.306 --> 00:24:47.346
Seong Man.

300
00:24:48.275 --> 00:24:49.876
The person with the most stocks...

301
00:24:50.646 --> 00:24:52.945
has the strongest power in the corporation,

302
00:24:53.175 --> 00:24:55.245
and the person who doesn't is the weakest.

303
00:24:57.116 --> 00:24:58.156
Even if...

304
00:24:58.886 --> 00:25:00.156
Boo Cheon's not the Jangs,

305
00:25:00.386 --> 00:25:03.326
you're well aware that...

306
00:25:04.025 --> 00:25:06.296
Boo Cheon and I have a lot of shares in Cheong A.

307
00:25:07.796 --> 00:25:09.396
I think...

308
00:25:10.636 --> 00:25:12.366
my deceased father...

309
00:25:13.035 --> 00:25:14.535
received shares...

310
00:25:15.336 --> 00:25:17.235
instead of cash...

311
00:25:18.406 --> 00:25:19.705
for this occasion.

312
00:25:24.745 --> 00:25:27.616
Push ahead with the plan...

313
00:25:29.086 --> 00:25:30.416
of splitting into 6 and 4...

314
00:25:31.316 --> 00:25:32.856
as we promised last time.

315
00:25:40.025 --> 00:25:42.025
- Let's go. - Pardon?

316
00:25:43.725 --> 00:25:44.866
To where?

317
00:25:44.995 --> 00:25:47.066
There's a meeting regarding Boo Cheon today.

318
00:25:48.336 --> 00:25:50.235
Let's say you called me.

319
00:26:36.116 --> 00:26:38.255
- Who called Executive Jung? - Father.

320
00:26:39.056 --> 00:26:40.626
I told her to come.

321
00:26:41.455 --> 00:26:42.985
I thought it'd make less noise...

322
00:26:43.626 --> 00:26:45.695
if she's here...

323
00:26:46.096 --> 00:26:47.725
as we're making a big decision...

324
00:26:48.195 --> 00:26:50.896
since Boo Cheon's in bed.

325
00:26:50.896 --> 00:26:53.596
- Mr. Woo. Begin. - Yes.

326
00:26:55.205 --> 00:26:56.606
"Chairman Jang Boo Cheon..."

327
00:26:57.005 --> 00:26:59.235
"was swamped with heavy workload..."

328
00:26:59.406 --> 00:27:01.146
"in order to grow Cheong A Bio..."

329
00:27:01.406 --> 00:27:02.775
"so that it's worsened his health."

330
00:27:02.945 --> 00:27:04.316
"So he will..."

331
00:27:04.745 --> 00:27:06.445
"put out his chairman post temporarily."

332
00:27:09.916 --> 00:27:13.316
"He recommends Kang Pil Joo whom he's watched for 20 years..."

333
00:27:13.925 --> 00:27:15.626
"as a candidate for..."

334
00:27:15.685 --> 00:27:16.886
"the empty chairman position..."

335
00:27:17.796 --> 00:27:19.255
"as a managerial executive."

336
00:27:25.035 --> 00:27:27.935
"Another candidate is the former chairman, Jang Seong Man."

337
00:27:28.166 --> 00:27:30.906
"Another candidate is someone who is recommended..."

338
00:27:30.935 --> 00:27:32.535
"by presidents of affiliates."

339
00:27:32.775 --> 00:27:35.705
"Above three people are candidates for the next chairman post..."

340
00:27:35.775 --> 00:27:37.846
"due to the absence of Chairman Jang Boo Cheon."

341
00:27:38.245 --> 00:27:41.715
"It has been decided arbitrarily by Honorary Chairman Jang..."

342
00:27:42.086 --> 00:27:44.586
"who has the most shares in Cheong A."

343
00:27:45.316 --> 00:27:48.025
"The board of directors should vote..."

344
00:27:48.225 --> 00:27:51.596
"by creating a personnel committee."

345
00:27:52.195 --> 00:27:54.925
It was from Honorary Chairman Jang.

346
00:27:55.025 --> 00:27:56.265
Chairman Jang Boo Cheon...

347
00:27:56.765 --> 00:27:58.435
has never put out his position.

348
00:27:59.666 --> 00:28:01.205
If you think the chairman sick in bed...

349
00:28:01.366 --> 00:28:03.435
is disadvantageous in terms of management,

350
00:28:05.675 --> 00:28:07.975
I'll accept a co-chairman.

351
00:28:08.205 --> 00:28:09.346
What did you say?

352
00:28:09.576 --> 00:28:11.775
If you don't accept my opinion on a co-chairman,

353
00:28:12.876 --> 00:28:14.185
I'll tell the board of directors...

354
00:28:14.745 --> 00:28:16.215
and the general meeting of stockholders that...

355
00:28:16.685 --> 00:28:19.556
the decision is against his opinion.

356
00:28:19.985 --> 00:28:21.455
My son, Soo Man...

357
00:28:28.326 --> 00:28:30.666
Let's do this. Dismissal of Chairman Jang Boo Cheon,

358
00:28:31.195 --> 00:28:32.336
co-chairman post,

359
00:28:32.935 --> 00:28:34.465
and selection of three candidates...

360
00:28:35.435 --> 00:28:37.205
Let's leave them all to the board of directors...

361
00:28:37.775 --> 00:28:40.646
and follow the decision they make.

362
00:28:46.916 --> 00:28:49.945
I think we should do what Attorney Kang says.

363
00:28:51.386 --> 00:28:52.616
What do you think, Mr. Woo?

364
00:28:52.785 --> 00:28:55.126
Yes. I think that's a good idea.

365
00:28:55.886 --> 00:28:58.755
Let's do that then. Dismiss the meeting.

366
00:29:36.925 --> 00:29:41.435
(Chairman Jang Boo Cheon)

367
00:29:46.876 --> 00:29:47.906
(Jang Boo Cheon)

368
00:29:47.906 --> 00:29:52.675
(Chairman)

369
00:29:52.675 --> 00:29:56.985
(Chairman)

370
00:30:41.425 --> 00:30:42.725
How did you know?

371
00:30:45.896 --> 00:30:48.205
Boo Cheon's lawyer told me.

372
00:30:48.636 --> 00:30:49.836
His lawyer?

373
00:30:51.376 --> 00:30:52.705
Boo Cheon and I...

374
00:30:53.136 --> 00:30:54.846
are divorced from today by the law.

375
00:30:55.245 --> 00:30:56.376
What?

376
00:30:59.275 --> 00:31:01.586
I've never heard you filed for divorce.

377
00:31:02.886 --> 00:31:04.616
Boo Cheon was planning to tell you...

378
00:31:05.015 --> 00:31:07.356
after he received the court's decision.

379
00:31:07.386 --> 00:31:08.925
Now that it's been decided,

380
00:31:08.925 --> 00:31:12.225
you probably received alimony and property as you wanted.

381
00:31:12.495 --> 00:31:13.525
My son...

382
00:31:14.666 --> 00:31:16.626
must've suffered...

383
00:31:17.965 --> 00:31:20.505
to catch you so desperately.

384
00:31:29.146 --> 00:31:30.346
Na Mo Hyun.

385
00:31:31.916 --> 00:31:33.245
Will you leave immediately?

386
00:31:33.985 --> 00:31:35.685
I don't want to be with you in the same room.

387
00:31:35.685 --> 00:31:37.715
Okay, Executive Jung Mal Ran.

388
00:31:38.616 --> 00:31:39.685
I'll leave.

389
00:31:41.525 --> 00:31:43.725
I hope Boo Cheon will get well soon.

390
00:31:58.749 --> 00:32:03.749
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E22 Money Flower "Everyone Will Be Against You"</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

391
00:32:18.995 --> 00:32:20.495
Since you want it,

392
00:32:21.166 --> 00:32:23.126
I'll think about the divorce.

393
00:32:24.495 --> 00:32:25.535
But...

394
00:32:28.636 --> 00:32:29.935
if...

395
00:32:33.175 --> 00:32:35.475
I can never break up with you,

396
00:32:37.346 --> 00:32:38.346
then...

397
00:32:39.515 --> 00:32:40.816
please turn back to me.

398
00:32:41.916 --> 00:32:42.916
Please.

399
00:32:45.816 --> 00:32:47.015
Mo Hyun.

400
00:33:07.445 --> 00:33:10.245
I heard you've got the decision on the lawsuit.

401
00:33:11.146 --> 00:33:12.146
Yes.

402
00:33:16.846 --> 00:33:19.755
- What has happened to Boo Cheon? - I think...

403
00:33:20.685 --> 00:33:22.425
you should hear it from him...

404
00:33:23.156 --> 00:33:24.796
when he wakes up.

405
00:33:25.525 --> 00:33:26.695
Boo Cheon...

406
00:33:27.896 --> 00:33:29.995
should have left Mooshimwon.

407
00:33:33.035 --> 00:33:34.435
All three of us...

408
00:33:36.005 --> 00:33:37.576
should have left...

409
00:33:44.975 --> 00:33:46.376
Why did you want to see me?

410
00:34:03.695 --> 00:34:05.096
It's what you mentioned before...

411
00:34:05.435 --> 00:34:06.765
Congressman Na...

412
00:34:07.205 --> 00:34:09.305
recorded every time he met...

413
00:34:09.705 --> 00:34:11.135
someone important.

414
00:34:12.176 --> 00:34:16.006
The formal president, ministers, and politicians.

415
00:34:16.506 --> 00:34:18.975
It's small,

416
00:34:21.785 --> 00:34:23.685
but it's pretty much a nuclear bomb.

417
00:34:28.325 --> 00:34:29.325
Whether to...

418
00:34:30.495 --> 00:34:32.856
reveal it to the world or not...

419
00:34:34.225 --> 00:34:37.095
is totally up to Congressman Na,

420
00:34:38.666 --> 00:34:40.736
so I kept it secure.

421
00:34:41.035 --> 00:34:43.106
If I had it from the beginning,

422
00:34:44.776 --> 00:34:46.405
I wouldn't have been able to bear it.

423
00:34:49.546 --> 00:34:51.316
Cheong A Foundation slush fund data.

424
00:34:52.216 --> 00:34:53.845
Father's recording.

425
00:34:55.046 --> 00:34:56.546
Father's statement once he recovers.

426
00:34:59.356 --> 00:35:01.126
From now on, all these will...

427
00:35:02.856 --> 00:35:04.756
torment you.

428
00:35:14.405 --> 00:35:17.276
I apologize for calling a meeting at such late night.

429
00:35:18.276 --> 00:35:19.506
The biggest concern...

430
00:35:19.736 --> 00:35:21.776
of the board of directors is sudden fluctuation...

431
00:35:21.776 --> 00:35:24.376
in stock price caused by frequent replacement of chairman.

432
00:35:24.816 --> 00:35:27.716
So it's been narrowed down...

433
00:35:27.916 --> 00:35:30.916
to two candidates with defense of management right,

434
00:35:31.515 --> 00:35:33.926
who are President Jang Seong Man and Director Kang Pil Joo.

435
00:35:34.155 --> 00:35:35.856
The election will be held during the meeting.

436
00:35:40.296 --> 00:35:42.095
You've made the right decision.

437
00:35:43.225 --> 00:35:47.106
The ability to win stockholders' hearts is important too.

438
00:35:47.705 --> 00:35:49.836
Also they know well about you two,

439
00:35:50.135 --> 00:35:53.405
they'll vote for the one whom they believe to bring larger profit.

440
00:35:53.705 --> 00:35:56.205
The chairman election will be held...

441
00:35:56.305 --> 00:35:58.316
at the extraordinary general meeting scheduled next week.

442
00:35:58.676 --> 00:36:00.416
It might dishearten you...

443
00:36:00.416 --> 00:36:02.586
even before the meeting is held.

444
00:36:02.885 --> 00:36:04.015
Father,

445
00:36:04.586 --> 00:36:07.486
considering the shares of Mal Ran and Boo Cheon...

446
00:36:07.885 --> 00:36:10.526
and those of mine and Yeo Cheon, albeit small, altogether,

447
00:36:11.196 --> 00:36:12.955
we might be able to...

448
00:36:13.595 --> 00:36:16.126
predict the result of the general meeting here.

449
00:36:17.495 --> 00:36:19.796
Should I offer my congratulations in advance, Dad?

450
00:36:20.736 --> 00:36:24.176
Attorney Kang also has a large number of Cheong A Bio shares.

451
00:36:25.606 --> 00:36:27.446
If he manages to secure preferred shares,

452
00:36:28.006 --> 00:36:30.006
the election might get fierce.

453
00:36:36.486 --> 00:36:37.515
Father,

454
00:36:38.356 --> 00:36:42.086
did you buy Attorney Kang shares of Cheong A Bio...

455
00:36:42.725 --> 00:36:45.225
with the money you lent from Mr. Cha?

456
00:36:46.796 --> 00:36:49.225
I told you I'd buy Cheong A Bio shares when I became...

457
00:36:49.225 --> 00:36:50.995
the vice president, but you said no.

458
00:36:51.836 --> 00:36:53.296
Why did you let Attorney Kang...

459
00:36:59.236 --> 00:37:00.546
Executive Jung...

460
00:37:00.905 --> 00:37:02.376
gave me...

461
00:37:03.205 --> 00:37:05.276
half of Daeil Distribution shares she had.

462
00:37:05.515 --> 00:37:08.916
I'm sure it will be of big help at the meeting...

463
00:37:09.615 --> 00:37:12.885
as Daeil Distribution has management right of Cheong A Bio.

464
00:37:15.926 --> 00:37:17.055
Mal Ran,

465
00:37:18.555 --> 00:37:20.495
why did you give your shares...

466
00:37:34.305 --> 00:37:36.376
So Attorney Kang successfully...

467
00:37:37.006 --> 00:37:38.676
ripped me and Executive Jung off...

468
00:37:39.216 --> 00:37:41.416
in the end.

469
00:37:52.196 --> 00:37:53.426
Executive Jung...

470
00:37:53.796 --> 00:37:55.196
gave me...

471
00:37:55.765 --> 00:37:57.865
half of Daeil Distribution shares she had.

472
00:37:58.095 --> 00:38:01.606
I'm sure it will be of big help at the meeting...

473
00:38:07.075 --> 00:38:09.305
Chairman Jang Boo Cheon woke up.

474
00:38:12.416 --> 00:38:13.446
Secretary Ahn.

475
00:38:21.285 --> 00:38:22.325
Boo Cheon.

476
00:38:27.055 --> 00:38:28.265
I'm glad you are back.

477
00:38:30.066 --> 00:38:31.135
Mom...

478
00:38:32.635 --> 00:38:34.205
I made you worry a lot.

479
00:38:40.336 --> 00:38:43.245
Is it okay for him to speak like that?

480
00:38:44.745 --> 00:38:47.015
He would stop talking if he finds it hard.

481
00:38:48.845 --> 00:38:51.115
I'm sure he has a lot to say.

482
00:38:56.285 --> 00:38:57.325
Go ahead.

483
00:38:58.126 --> 00:38:59.825
Say whatever you want to say.

484
00:39:01.495 --> 00:39:02.566
What about Pil Joo?

485
00:39:08.966 --> 00:39:11.805
(List of Properties to be Bequeathed in Advance)

486
00:39:14.805 --> 00:39:15.946
What is this?

487
00:39:16.546 --> 00:39:17.816
This is the list of properties...

488
00:39:18.446 --> 00:39:21.245
you bestowed to Boo Cheon in advance.

489
00:39:21.885 --> 00:39:24.055
Please take a look and sign...

490
00:39:24.155 --> 00:39:27.285
the lawsuit consent form for property transfer nullification.

491
00:39:27.426 --> 00:39:29.856
When you brought it up before,

492
00:39:29.856 --> 00:39:31.756
I didn't give you any answer.

493
00:39:31.856 --> 00:39:33.356
And you brought it again?

494
00:39:34.966 --> 00:39:36.666
If I proceed with this suit,

495
00:39:37.635 --> 00:39:40.635
the public will find out that Boo Cheon isn't the Jangs.

496
00:39:40.905 --> 00:39:41.966
Executive Jung...

497
00:39:42.405 --> 00:39:44.435
also doesn't want it to be...

498
00:39:44.736 --> 00:39:46.535
known to people.

499
00:39:47.845 --> 00:39:49.006
If you just show her...

500
00:39:49.176 --> 00:39:51.776
that you're ready to file the suit,

501
00:39:52.345 --> 00:39:53.916
she'll give up on her shares.

502
00:39:56.345 --> 00:39:57.515
Leave it here.

503
00:39:59.216 --> 00:40:00.256
Okay.

504
00:40:01.486 --> 00:40:04.026
Is Chairman Jang Boo Cheon conscious?

505
00:40:12.765 --> 00:40:15.305
Chairman Jang Boo Cheon just opened his eyes.

506
00:40:15.435 --> 00:40:17.676
Secretary Ahn is here...

507
00:40:17.676 --> 00:40:20.135
because Executive sent Secretary Ahn...

508
00:40:20.135 --> 00:40:21.705
to deliver the news directly.

509
00:40:22.506 --> 00:40:23.676
Sir,

510
00:40:23.876 --> 00:40:26.575
I came to inform that Chairman Jang has come back to his senses...

511
00:40:26.716 --> 00:40:28.316
as Executive Jung instructed.

512
00:40:29.586 --> 00:40:31.015
Tell her that I am informed.

513
00:40:31.885 --> 00:40:33.216
I will get going, sir.

514
00:40:44.396 --> 00:40:46.466
(Cheong A Hospital)

515
00:41:00.615 --> 00:41:01.986
Honorary Chairman said...

516
00:41:02.546 --> 00:41:05.586
he will file the suit to nullify property transfer.

517
00:41:07.856 --> 00:41:08.955
Are you sure?

518
00:41:09.086 --> 00:41:10.185
Yes.

519
00:41:11.495 --> 00:41:13.655
I'm giving you advice as a lawyer.

520
00:41:14.765 --> 00:41:16.095
You'd better...

521
00:41:16.595 --> 00:41:18.966
give up on the shares you received...

522
00:41:19.095 --> 00:41:20.296
before you stand trial.

523
00:41:21.566 --> 00:41:22.736
Until when...

524
00:41:23.205 --> 00:41:25.575
are you going to torture Boo Cheon and me?

525
00:41:26.435 --> 00:41:27.905
Until you leave.

526
00:41:29.446 --> 00:41:32.615
I thought you came with a flag of truce already.

527
00:41:36.885 --> 00:41:38.486
That was a strategic decision.

528
00:41:41.385 --> 00:41:43.455
I know you plan to collude with President Jang Seong Man...

529
00:41:43.955 --> 00:41:45.396
and throw me...

530
00:41:45.526 --> 00:41:47.696
and Honorary Chairman out.

531
00:41:50.995 --> 00:41:52.236
Did you eavesdrop again?

532
00:41:52.365 --> 00:41:54.666
Would it have been necessary?

533
00:41:55.635 --> 00:41:56.666
I know...

534
00:41:58.836 --> 00:42:00.475
you very well.

535
00:42:05.046 --> 00:42:06.146
Go inside.

536
00:42:07.316 --> 00:42:08.986
He asked for you as soon as he woke up.

537
00:42:43.515 --> 00:42:44.685
How does it feel?

538
00:42:47.285 --> 00:42:50.796
You made Grandfather kill me by telling him that I'm not the Jangs,

539
00:42:52.196 --> 00:42:55.825
and you saved me from flames. What does it feel like?

540
00:42:58.535 --> 00:42:59.865
I was really curious.

541
00:43:12.916 --> 00:43:14.515
Blame your mom.

542
00:43:16.146 --> 00:43:18.015
You wouldn't have gone...

543
00:43:19.055 --> 00:43:21.426
through such things if you were the Jangs.

544
00:43:21.626 --> 00:43:24.396
I already resent her bitterly.

545
00:43:24.825 --> 00:43:25.856
I resent Mom.

546
00:43:28.265 --> 00:43:29.526
I thought...

547
00:43:30.325 --> 00:43:32.035
you chose me over Yeo Cheon...

548
00:43:32.035 --> 00:43:34.466
because he's strong-minded and I am more of a pushover.

549
00:43:34.905 --> 00:43:35.966
But...

550
00:43:38.305 --> 00:43:41.646
you stayed next to me for such a long time because of my mom.

551
00:43:47.486 --> 00:43:48.546
Did you...

552
00:43:49.086 --> 00:43:51.785
strengthen your resolution for revenge...

553
00:43:53.586 --> 00:43:55.256
whenever you saw me...

554
00:43:56.756 --> 00:43:58.455
for the last 20 years?

555
00:43:59.026 --> 00:44:00.256
The target of my revenge...

556
00:44:01.265 --> 00:44:03.865
isn't you, but Executive Jung Mal Ran.

557
00:44:06.836 --> 00:44:09.966
Is this what you chose for your life after coming back from death's door?

558
00:44:12.606 --> 00:44:14.376
Do you think it really makes sense?

559
00:44:15.776 --> 00:44:17.916
I had only two options...

560
00:44:19.345 --> 00:44:20.946
to choose.

561
00:44:24.555 --> 00:44:26.955
Leading my life with the goal...

562
00:44:28.825 --> 00:44:31.225
to take revenge on Executive Jung.

563
00:44:32.955 --> 00:44:33.966
Or...

564
00:44:35.526 --> 00:44:36.995
walking into the river...

565
00:44:37.796 --> 00:44:39.166
again.

566
00:44:43.305 --> 00:44:44.676
So you've always been...

567
00:44:45.805 --> 00:44:48.575
willing to die if you can't take revenge?

568
00:44:50.745 --> 00:44:52.276
It was pretty simple to me.

569
00:44:53.216 --> 00:44:54.385
If I...

570
00:44:54.916 --> 00:44:56.646
walk into the river again,

571
00:44:57.256 --> 00:45:00.986
my mother, brother, father,

572
00:45:01.926 --> 00:45:02.926
and...

573
00:45:05.095 --> 00:45:06.655
Vice Chairman Jang Soo Man...

574
00:45:08.066 --> 00:45:09.526
I'll meet them all.

575
00:45:18.535 --> 00:45:19.535
So...

576
00:45:20.606 --> 00:45:23.075
to get back at my mother,

577
00:45:26.376 --> 00:45:29.185
you made me marry Mo Hyun...

578
00:45:30.515 --> 00:45:32.316
to make me become the chairman...

579
00:45:33.256 --> 00:45:35.725
when I wasn't even interested in becoming a chairman.

580
00:45:37.325 --> 00:45:38.896
Then you revealed the truth...

581
00:45:39.426 --> 00:45:41.126
and made Mo Hyun leave me,

582
00:45:43.765 --> 00:45:45.566
so you can have Cheong A Group?

583
00:45:49.506 --> 00:45:50.676
You scumbag.

584
00:46:00.515 --> 00:46:03.986
Why did you even save my life after putting me to shame?

585
00:46:06.885 --> 00:46:07.885
You know what?

586
00:46:11.225 --> 00:46:12.926
It feels even worse...

587
00:46:14.666 --> 00:46:16.396
that you're the one who saved me.

588
00:46:19.135 --> 00:46:21.765
It's not that I wanted to save your life.

589
00:46:23.305 --> 00:46:24.836
Don't flatter yourself.

590
00:46:26.736 --> 00:46:27.845
If you had died,

591
00:46:30.946 --> 00:46:33.615
I'd have taken all the blame for it, so I saved you.

592
00:46:36.146 --> 00:46:37.356
You jerk.

593
00:46:53.865 --> 00:46:56.265
Seoul Central District Prosecutor’s Office said Former Chairman Jang...

594
00:46:56.265 --> 00:46:58.876
who's standing trial for issuing fraudulent corporate bills...

595
00:46:58.905 --> 00:47:00.676
and illegally supporting affiliates...

596
00:47:00.676 --> 00:47:03.245
is under investigation for evasion of taxes.

597
00:47:03.776 --> 00:47:06.876
It will spell bad news for him as it happened while he was...

598
00:47:06.916 --> 00:47:10.316
vying with Director Kang Pil Joo for the position of chairman,

599
00:47:10.455 --> 00:47:11.955
vacated by Jang Boo Cheon.

600
00:47:12.285 --> 00:47:15.426
Meanwhile, all the attention is now...

601
00:47:15.426 --> 00:47:17.356
on who will be the new chairman of Cheong A Bio...

602
00:47:17.595 --> 00:47:19.555
as the holding company will have...

603
00:47:19.595 --> 00:47:21.796
the extraordinary general meeting to decide it tomorrow.

604
00:47:23.166 --> 00:47:24.236
I'm taking care of...

605
00:47:24.935 --> 00:47:27.466
the issues regarding the corporate bills...

606
00:47:28.265 --> 00:47:30.575
and corporate tax in the trials.

607
00:47:31.305 --> 00:47:33.205
Then why did you want to talk to me in private?

608
00:47:36.046 --> 00:47:37.946
Let's get this over with...

609
00:47:38.376 --> 00:47:40.685
and return to our homes for dinner.

610
00:47:42.716 --> 00:47:45.955
Chairman Jang Seong Man, you won't be going home for a while.

611
00:47:49.356 --> 00:47:51.495
You're under investigation for tax evasion...

612
00:47:51.495 --> 00:47:52.926
of tens of millions of dollars.

613
00:47:53.225 --> 00:47:55.725
For your information, tax evasion...

614
00:47:56.126 --> 00:47:58.365
of more than 300,000 dollars means jail time.

615
00:48:13.816 --> 00:48:15.745
Chairman Jang, Chairman Jang Seong Man is...

616
00:48:15.745 --> 00:48:17.816
arrested for tax evasion.

617
00:48:18.615 --> 00:48:19.615
What?

618
00:48:21.586 --> 00:48:23.586
Attorney Kang, that jerk.

619
00:48:24.225 --> 00:48:25.555
Bring him here now.

620
00:48:32.166 --> 00:48:35.635
I handed over the materials to the prosecution.

621
00:48:39.176 --> 00:48:40.475
Chairman Jang Seong Man...

622
00:48:40.975 --> 00:48:43.345
won't be able to avoid imprisonment.

623
00:48:44.146 --> 00:48:46.446
You'll need to get him a good attorney.

624
00:48:51.885 --> 00:48:54.055
Chairman Jang, the board of directors...

625
00:48:54.486 --> 00:48:57.095
will rule him out as a candidate.

626
00:48:58.155 --> 00:49:01.526
Then Attorney Kang will be the sole candidate, and

627
00:49:02.066 --> 00:49:03.995
they'll only cast a vote of yes or no on him.

628

(Extraordinary General Meeting of Cheong A Bio)

629
00:49:24.115 --> 00:49:25.285
May I see your ID?

630
00:49:25.285 --> 00:49:27.685
(Identification Card)

631
00:49:29.385 --> 00:49:30.385
Hello, sir.

632
00:49:33.126 --> 00:49:34.896
- Hello, ma'am. - Hello.

633
00:49:35.796 --> 00:49:36.796
Please come in.

634
00:49:52.416 --> 00:49:53.946
The director is coming.

635
00:50:14.006 --> 00:50:16.336
The extraordinary general meeting has just begun.

636
00:50:16.865 --> 00:50:17.876
Okay.

637
00:50:18.606 --> 00:50:21.876
Did you give my power of attorney to them?

638
00:50:22.446 --> 00:50:24.475
Yes, sir. You didn't want...

639
00:50:25.075 --> 00:50:28.515
the Jang family to attend the meeting,

640
00:50:29.586 --> 00:50:31.856
so they all submitted the power of attorney.

641
00:50:44.666 --> 00:50:46.095
Did you vote no...

642
00:50:46.995 --> 00:50:49.666
on Pil Joo's appointment as chairman with our shares?

643
00:50:51.106 --> 00:50:52.205
Of course I did.

644
00:50:54.106 --> 00:50:55.575
I'll stop Pil Joo...

645
00:50:56.146 --> 00:50:57.946
from becoming the chairman at all costs.

646
00:51:18.865 --> 00:51:19.865
(Yong Goo)

647
00:51:20.606 --> 00:51:24.236
Pil Joo, I calculated the shares of those at the meeting.

648
00:51:24.606 --> 00:51:27.035
40 percent of them is in favor, and 47 percent is against.

649
00:51:27.805 --> 00:51:30.845
At this rate, the appointment of the chairmanship will be voted down.

650
00:52:09.345 --> 00:52:11.916
Chairman Jang.

651
00:52:12.486 --> 00:52:14.026
Please vote yes with your shares.

652
00:52:14.356 --> 00:52:15.455
I won't.

653
00:52:17.926 --> 00:52:18.926
Mr. Woo.

654
00:52:19.756 --> 00:52:20.865
Please excuse us for a second.

655
00:52:42.385 --> 00:52:43.955
(List of Borrowed-name Bank Accounts)

656
00:52:46.986 --> 00:52:48.785
How did you get this?

657
00:52:49.126 --> 00:52:50.325
It's the list...

658
00:52:51.356 --> 00:52:52.626
of borrowed-name bank accounts...

659
00:52:53.256 --> 00:52:55.796
you've hidden all this time.

660
00:52:56.926 --> 00:52:58.365
It's more than four billion dollars.

661
00:53:10.345 --> 00:53:11.345
If you...

662
00:53:12.176 --> 00:53:13.986
don't vote for me,

663
00:53:16.416 --> 00:53:18.455
I will reveal this list...

664
00:53:20.856 --> 00:53:22.356
to the public.

665
00:53:34.935 --> 00:53:35.935
Mr. Woo.

666
00:53:47.716 --> 00:53:48.946
Tell my deputy to vote for yes...

667
00:53:49.586 --> 00:53:52.216
with my shares.

668
00:54:37.935 --> 00:54:40.265
In today's extraordinary general meeting of Cheong A,

669
00:54:40.336 --> 00:54:43.336
Director Kang Pil Joo has been voted...

670
00:54:43.435 --> 00:54:45.405

Mr. Woo.

You must've prepared a lot for this.
