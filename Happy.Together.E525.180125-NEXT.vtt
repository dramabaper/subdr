3
00:00:05.506 --> 00:00:07.315
It's always better when we're together,

4
00:00:07.315 --> 00:00:08.645
- Happy Together! - Happy Together!

5
00:00:08.645 --> 00:00:10.815
(Happy Together, Along with the Queens)

6
00:00:11.645 --> 00:00:13.315
(I can't be missed.)

7
00:00:14.216 --> 00:00:15.816
(The charismatic actress...)

8
00:00:15.816 --> 00:00:17.255
(with innocence of a little girl)

9
00:00:18.086 --> 00:00:19.825
(Good expressive skills, good sense of humor)

10
00:00:20.697 --> 00:00:22.727
(The versatile and talented)

11
00:00:22.926 --> 00:00:25.095
(The stars who guarantee a success gathered here.)

12
00:00:25.426 --> 00:00:27.435
Messy hair

13
00:00:27.435 --> 00:00:30.336
(From charming clumsiness...)

14
00:00:30.336 --> 00:00:33.606
(to an unexpected charm)

15
00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:35.736
(Please stop humiliating me.)

16
00:00:37.045 --> 00:00:39.816
(Along with the Queens continues.)

17
00:00:39.916 --> 00:00:42.645
Hae Sun earned money by singing when she was a child.

18
00:00:42.645 --> 00:00:45.545
While my neighbors were cleaning cabbage or young radish together,

19
00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:48.115
they asked me to sing when they saw me passing by.

20
00:00:48.115 --> 00:00:50.956
- I heard I didn't do it for free. - Then what?

21
00:00:50.986 --> 00:00:53.096
- You were a pro at that. - I asked for money...

22
00:00:53.556 --> 00:00:57.125
for my performance, and they gave me 1 or 2 cents.

23
00:00:57.426 --> 00:00:59.426
- Could you sing a bit for us? - Sing?

24
00:00:59.895 --> 00:01:02.566
Sing? Right. I'll... I should sing.

25
00:01:03.265 --> 00:01:05.405
Are you serious? I'm surprised.

26
00:01:05.735 --> 00:01:07.636
If I could borrow this just once...

27
00:01:07.636 --> 00:01:10.045
- I'm not very good at this, - Go ahead.

28
00:01:10.045 --> 00:01:12.506
but I'll imitate Song Eun I imitating Lee Sun Hee.

29
00:01:12.646 --> 00:01:13.646
What? Goodness.

30
00:01:13.646 --> 00:01:15.476
- That sounds exciting. - She took it to another level.

31
00:01:15.476 --> 00:01:17.716
Eun I is really good at imitating Sun Hee.

32
00:01:18.815 --> 00:01:21.086
(Queen Eun I, the master of imitating Lee Sun Hee)

33
00:01:22.455 --> 00:01:24.886
(This became legendary.)

34
00:01:25.056 --> 00:01:26.795
- I'll do my best. - It's okay.

35
00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:28.825
- I'm embarrassed. - This is unexpected.

36
00:01:28.825 --> 00:01:29.966
Oh, you want to cover your mouth.

37
00:01:32.526 --> 00:01:35.836
(She starts singing shyly.)

38
00:01:35.836 --> 00:01:37.405
- I'm so nervous. - It wasn't so good.

39
00:01:37.405 --> 00:01:39.675
- Give me a moment. - You didn't sound like any of them.

40
00:01:39.675 --> 00:01:41.405
- I'm sorry. I'm too nervous. - It wasn't so good.

41
00:01:41.405 --> 00:01:42.735
- Please wait for a moment. - Okay.

42
00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:45.705
- I understand her. - She'll sing the climax.

43
00:01:46.845 --> 00:01:49.616
(She's still warming up her voice.)

44
00:01:50.416 --> 00:01:52.045
(Dusk falls)

45
00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:53.756
(Behind my back)

46
00:01:54.056 --> 00:01:55.455
(She sings her heart out covering her face.)

47
00:01:57.386 --> 00:02:01.655
(The queen of mask singer, a doctor, a prosecutor, and a judge)

48
00:02:04.425 --> 00:02:07.535
(You whispered these words to me)

49
00:02:07.635 --> 00:02:09.565
- I'm so embarrassed. - She sings really well.

50
00:02:10.236 --> 00:02:11.405
She's good.

51
00:02:11.435 --> 00:02:13.375
- She sings so well. - Indeed.

52
00:02:13.405 --> 00:02:15.135
- She sings so well. - She's really good.

53
00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:18.306
I practiced hard to imitate Eun I.

54
00:02:19.046 --> 00:02:20.415
- Can you sing this part? - "Beautiful Country".

55
00:02:20.415 --> 00:02:22.445
(Can she imitate Eun I singing "Beautiful Country"?)

56
00:02:22.445 --> 00:02:23.646
- You prepared this too, right? - She did.

57
00:02:23.815 --> 00:02:26.716
(Nothing is impossible for Hae Sun.)

58
00:02:29.016 --> 00:02:31.785
(Singing the climax)

59
00:02:33.796 --> 00:02:35.926
(She sings with a powerful voice.)

60
00:02:35.926 --> 00:02:36.926
She doesn't sound like Eun I.

61
00:02:37.026 --> 00:02:38.796
(Her voice resonates deeply.)

62
00:02:38.796 --> 00:02:39.836
Thank you.

63
00:02:39.996 --> 00:02:42.535
- She's so good. - She sings really well.

64
00:02:42.535 --> 00:02:44.065
You sound a little like So Chan Whee.

65
00:02:45.736 --> 00:02:46.935
He's right.

66
00:02:46.935 --> 00:02:47.935
- She has a similar voice. - Her voice...

67
00:02:47.935 --> 00:02:51.105
(Sing "Tears" from now on.)

68
00:02:52.375 --> 00:02:55.046
(It's a perfect song for you.)

69
00:02:55.646 --> 00:02:58.486
- I'm worried about Hae Sun... - She's cool.

70
00:02:58.486 --> 00:03:02.516
because after this episode airs,

71
00:03:02.586 --> 00:03:05.026
- some people will recognize her. - That won't happen.

72
00:03:05.026 --> 00:03:07.195
What would you say if someone says, "I enjoyed your episode"?

73
00:03:07.195 --> 00:03:08.496
I'd say, "You're mistaken." Then, I'll keep going.

74
00:03:08.956 --> 00:03:11.766
- She'd walk away like this. - I should always be consistent.

75
00:03:11.766 --> 00:03:13.366
- Will you say it wasn't you? - "You must be mistaken."

76
00:03:13.366 --> 00:03:16.035
"That's not me. Who? I don't know." And I'll walk away.

77
00:03:16.035 --> 00:03:18.935
If you see Hae Sun tomorrow, she might say you're mistaken.

78
00:03:18.935 --> 00:03:21.776
If she says that, she's definitely Hae Sun.

79
00:03:21.975 --> 00:03:23.746
(I got caught.)

80
00:03:23.746 --> 00:03:25.005
- That'll be her. - That's good.

81
00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:28.576
Se Jeong has been ranked first among female celebrities...

82
00:03:28.576 --> 00:03:30.646
in the advertisement model popularity rankings.

83
00:03:30.646 --> 00:03:32.546
(Kim Se Jeong, Ranked top as an advertisement model)

84
00:03:32.546 --> 00:03:33.956
She's been getting a lot of offers.

85
00:03:33.956 --> 00:03:36.255
I really liked your home appliance store commercial.

86
00:03:36.255 --> 00:03:37.426
What is your secret?

87
00:03:37.426 --> 00:03:40.625
I think it's just that I was lucky.

88
00:03:40.625 --> 00:03:43.526
When things got hard,

89
00:03:43.625 --> 00:03:45.266
I got through everything while smiling.

90
00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:49.035
- Maybe because it was memorable, - You have such a good image.

91
00:03:49.035 --> 00:03:52.005
- That's right. - I came to have this cheery image.

92
00:03:52.035 --> 00:03:54.935
- Many advertisers watch our show. - Is that so?

93
00:03:54.935 --> 00:03:57.276
Is there any type of advertisement you want to be in?

94
00:03:57.276 --> 00:03:58.345
I'd like model...

95
00:03:58.375 --> 00:03:59.746
- a fried chicken brand. - I see.

96
00:03:59.746 --> 00:04:01.176
- That would suit her. - Hasn't she modeled any brand?

97
00:04:01.176 --> 00:04:02.776
- Haven't you? - No, not a fried chicken brand.

98
00:04:02.845 --> 00:04:05.646
I always said I wanted it, but I didn't get any offers.

99
00:04:05.646 --> 00:04:08.255
- You'll get a chance. - Pretend to eat a drum stick.

100
00:04:08.255 --> 00:04:09.685
- Fried chicken? - How would you eat it?

101
00:04:09.855 --> 00:04:10.926
It would taste good.

102
00:04:11.586 --> 00:04:12.926
What should I do?

103
00:04:12.926 --> 00:04:16.326
I have an idea. Use your line, "I'm upset" from "School".

104
00:04:16.326 --> 00:04:19.095
For example, you can say, "I'll be upset if I can't eat more than one."

105
00:04:22.336 --> 00:04:26.506
I would be upset if I get fat after enjoying fried chicken.

106
00:04:26.735 --> 00:04:27.735
(Oh, no. Don't be upset.)

107
00:04:27.735 --> 00:04:29.235
- She's cute. - She's so cute.

108
00:04:29.235 --> 00:04:30.405
- She'll get an offer. - How does she do that?

109
00:04:30.405 --> 00:04:33.146
- She's so cute. - Hyeon Gyeong also appeared...

110
00:04:33.276 --> 00:04:34.915
- in many TV commercials. - Say the line.

111
00:04:34.915 --> 00:04:36.285
Show us.

112
00:04:36.745 --> 00:04:38.545
The facial expression after a bite is important.

113
00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:39.785
Try to express that feeling.

114
00:04:40.016 --> 00:04:41.415
(Having a bite)

115
00:04:42.855 --> 00:04:45.355
If you don't eat this, I would be upset.

116
00:04:45.355 --> 00:04:47.155
(Excessive emotion)

117
00:04:48.126 --> 00:04:50.826
She sounded like, "Rice cake will go bad."

118
00:04:51.365 --> 00:04:53.896
- "Rice cake will go bad." - "Rice cake will go bad."

119
00:04:53.896 --> 00:04:56.095
"If you don't eat this, rice cake will go bad, and I'll be upset."

120
00:04:56.095 --> 00:04:57.466
"And it will smell bad too."

121
00:04:57.466 --> 00:04:59.706
Bo Reum, how about you try it too?

122
00:04:59.905 --> 00:05:01.936
- I'm not good at acting cute. - You don't have to be cute.

123
00:05:01.936 --> 00:05:03.745
- You can do it in your style. - But if your advertiser...

124
00:05:03.745 --> 00:05:05.975
- Like my role in "Go Back Couple". - In your own style.

125
00:05:05.975 --> 00:05:08.316
I'll use my popular line from "Go Back Couple".

126
00:05:08.316 --> 00:05:09.345
That's a good idea.

127
00:05:10.745 --> 00:05:14.186
(Bo Reum played a charismatic, tough girl in the drama.)

128
00:05:16.115 --> 00:05:17.956
(Having a bite)

129
00:05:18.555 --> 00:05:20.425
Hey. Did you take mine?

130
00:05:20.896 --> 00:05:21.896
Are you challenging me?

131
00:05:22.925 --> 00:05:25.396
- That was good. - It's like a catchphrase.

132
00:05:25.665 --> 00:05:26.995
- "I'll eat all by myself." - That's right.

133
00:05:26.995 --> 00:05:28.436
Soo Kyung, it's your turn.

134
00:05:28.636 --> 00:05:30.006
When you eat chicken,

135
00:05:30.006 --> 00:05:32.936
you have to show how you eat the meat off the bone.

136
00:05:32.936 --> 00:05:35.235
- Make it look elegant. - That's good.

137
00:05:35.235 --> 00:05:37.105
(She's describing in detail.)

138
00:05:37.745 --> 00:05:39.675
(She ate all the meat off the bone.)

139
00:05:39.675 --> 00:05:40.675
(Tasty)

140
00:05:41.045 --> 00:05:42.175
(What a detailed expression.)

141
00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:43.816
- That was very expressive. - She's on a different level.

142
00:05:43.816 --> 00:05:47.285
- No need for words as food is good. - Right.

143
00:05:47.285 --> 00:05:48.415
- She's right. - I should do something about it.

144
00:05:48.415 --> 00:05:51.186
And how you swallow it and the sound of it.

145
00:05:51.186 --> 00:05:52.355
Hae Sun, why don't you...

146
00:05:52.355 --> 00:05:54.995
No. I will skip this for the sake of Soo Kyung.

147
00:05:56.725 --> 00:05:59.535
- That's even harsher. - Are you humiliating me?

148
00:05:59.535 --> 00:06:00.966
- No, I'm not humiliating you. - Hae Sun.

149
00:06:00.995 --> 00:06:03.136
- You're so mean. - Gosh. Seriously.

150
00:06:03.136 --> 00:06:06.136
- Show us. - Are you humiliating her again?

151
00:06:06.136 --> 00:06:07.836
- She's smart. - That's not my intention.

152
00:06:07.836 --> 00:06:09.475
- It's better if you just do it. - All right.

153
00:06:09.475 --> 00:06:11.506
- Try it. "Bae Hae Sun Chicken". - All right.

154
00:06:12.446 --> 00:06:14.516
(She immerses herself in the situation.)

155
00:06:16.686 --> 00:06:17.745
(Raising her eyebrow)

156
00:06:20.055 --> 00:06:21.055
My gosh. It's good.

157
00:06:23.686 --> 00:06:25.026
- I was drawn to it. - I'm craving it now.

158
00:06:25.026 --> 00:06:27.126
- That was a good point. - She said it quietly, but...

159
00:06:27.126 --> 00:06:29.095
- I almost ordered one. - That was good.

160
00:06:29.095 --> 00:06:30.665
- Like "The Solitary Gourmet". - That's right.

161
00:06:30.665 --> 00:06:32.365
I'm sure she prepared this too.

162
00:06:32.365 --> 00:06:34.836
- No. I improvised it. - It was short, but impressive.

163
00:06:34.836 --> 00:06:37.206
You should've made it as impressive as hers.

164
00:06:37.206 --> 00:06:38.665
I will learn from her.

165
00:06:39.466 --> 00:06:42.235
Did I do something wrong again? Oh, no.

166
00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:44.376
Whatever she does, she would make it a success.

167
00:06:45.605 --> 00:06:47.545
- I mean it. She's so talented. - Thank you.

168
00:06:47.545 --> 00:06:49.485
You ended up complimenting her again.

169
00:06:49.485 --> 00:06:51.045
- I don't know what to say. - I'm impressed.

170
00:06:51.045 --> 00:06:53.485
Se Jeong said Bo Reum and Bae Sun will become successful.

171
00:06:53.485 --> 00:06:54.756
That's right.

172
00:06:54.756 --> 00:06:56.285
What about Soo Kyung?

173
00:06:56.855 --> 00:06:57.886
I think she needs...

174
00:06:57.886 --> 00:07:00.095
Nothing goes well for you today, Soo Kyung.

175
00:07:00.126 --> 00:07:01.925
There are good days and bad days.

176
00:07:01.925 --> 00:07:03.696
However, she keeps trying new things.

177
00:07:04.795 --> 00:07:05.826
But it doesn't work out well.

178
00:07:05.896 --> 00:07:07.235
- That's a good point. - She'll be successful...

179
00:07:07.235 --> 00:07:09.396
Trying new things are very important.

180
00:07:09.396 --> 00:07:11.305
- Absolutely. She's authentic. - Right.

181
00:07:11.305 --> 00:07:12.876
- I think so too. - Right.

182
00:07:12.876 --> 00:07:14.605
In fact, that's what I'm trying to show.

183
00:07:14.805 --> 00:07:16.446
- What do you mean? - My authentic charm.

184
00:07:16.446 --> 00:07:17.446
Don't say that.

185
00:07:17.845 --> 00:07:19.245
She accepts all the compliments she gets.

186
00:07:19.245 --> 00:07:22.475
- He looked so scary just now. - I know.

187
00:07:22.475 --> 00:07:23.816
She should know when to stop.

188
00:07:24.446 --> 00:07:27.355
There's a story behind her line, "I'm upset."

189
00:07:27.355 --> 00:07:28.386
What is it?

190
00:07:29.316 --> 00:07:34.456
It was the last scene of the drama.

191
00:07:35.055 --> 00:07:37.326
(Honey)

192
00:07:39.836 --> 00:07:43.836
(Se Jeong did her very best to act cute.)

193
00:07:44.235 --> 00:07:46.876
However, toward the end of the drama,

194
00:07:46.876 --> 00:07:49.545
I had to shoot the drama without getting enough sleep.

195
00:07:49.545 --> 00:07:52.845
- So I wasn't myself at that time. - I see.

196
00:07:52.845 --> 00:07:55.276
I would've had no confidence in doing that,

197
00:07:55.276 --> 00:07:57.485
but I said my lines so naturally...

198
00:07:57.485 --> 00:07:59.386
- with excitement and confidence. - Right.

199
00:07:59.386 --> 00:08:02.516
- You don't act cute in real life. - I'm not that type of person.

200
00:08:02.516 --> 00:08:04.456
At that time, I was so happy.

201
00:08:05.826 --> 00:08:08.595
- You're down-to-earth and boyish. - That's right.

202
00:08:08.595 --> 00:08:11.865
I act cute when I'm excited.

203
00:08:11.865 --> 00:08:14.836
I heard you will show us a new cute act for us.

204
00:08:15.535 --> 00:08:16.535
(Embarrassed)

205
00:08:16.566 --> 00:08:18.136
- Just relax. - For Happy Together.

206
00:08:18.136 --> 00:08:20.475
(Warming up her voice first)

207
00:08:22.136 --> 00:08:23.646
The queens are on Happy Together.

208
00:08:23.646 --> 00:08:25.845
If you switch the channel, I would be upset.

209
00:08:27.216 --> 00:08:29.946
- She's so cute. - She's good.

210
00:08:29.946 --> 00:08:31.446
This will be used for the preview.

211
00:08:32.086 --> 00:08:33.355
- This will be used for the preview. - That's right.

212
00:08:33.716 --> 00:08:35.515
Hyeon Gyeong said rice cake will go bad.

213
00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:36.586
"Rice cake will go bad."

214
00:08:36.586 --> 00:08:38.926
(I'll do it again since you like it.)

215
00:08:38.926 --> 00:08:40.056
- "Rice cake..." - I'm sorry,

216
00:08:40.056 --> 00:08:42.826
- "Rice cake will go bad." - but your mouth looks so dry.

217
00:08:43.095 --> 00:08:45.225
(Rubbing)

218
00:08:45.225 --> 00:08:46.265
It's too dry.

219
00:08:46.966 --> 00:08:48.836
- She's so funny. - That was good.

220
00:08:48.836 --> 00:08:51.235
- You'll be cast in a TV commercial. - I like that.

221
00:08:51.666 --> 00:08:52.666
I really like it.

222
00:08:52.936 --> 00:08:55.906
There's something in common among a T-rex, a lion,

223
00:08:55.906 --> 00:08:57.745
- and Soo Kyung. - What is it?

224
00:08:58.206 --> 00:08:59.206
They're all carnivorous animals.

225
00:08:59.946 --> 00:09:01.015
- Is that so? - Did you just call me an animal?

226
00:09:01.015 --> 00:09:03.015
You're an animal, not a plant.

227
00:09:03.015 --> 00:09:04.946
- Do you like meat? - She likes meat so much.

228
00:09:04.946 --> 00:09:07.156
- Yes. - You're the weight loss queen.

229
00:09:07.156 --> 00:09:09.156
A meat lover doesn't sound suitable for your nickname.

230
00:09:09.216 --> 00:09:13.926
If you eat meat without carbs, you don't gain weight.

231
00:09:13.926 --> 00:09:15.696
- Is that right? - Yes. You haven't tried it, right?

232
00:09:16.166 --> 00:09:17.225
Of course not.

233
00:09:17.225 --> 00:09:18.265
(Confident)

234
00:09:18.926 --> 00:09:20.235
It's called Atkins diet.

235
00:09:20.235 --> 00:09:22.235
- There's Atkins diet program. - Right.

236
00:09:22.235 --> 00:09:23.836
Also, I...

237
00:09:24.235 --> 00:09:28.076
weighed up to 68kg in high school.

238
00:09:28.635 --> 00:09:30.375
- Is that true? - Yes, I weighed 68kg.

239
00:09:30.375 --> 00:09:32.076
I was quite heavy, right?

240
00:09:32.076 --> 00:09:36.645
Back then, I never skipped breakfast.

241
00:09:36.645 --> 00:09:39.416
I ate some food in my lunch box after my first class.

242
00:09:39.416 --> 00:09:42.015
I ate a snack like tteokbokki during a break...

243
00:09:42.015 --> 00:09:43.926
and ate lunch during the lunch break.

244
00:09:43.926 --> 00:09:46.625
After lunch, I ate snacks during a break.

245
00:09:46.625 --> 00:09:49.125
After school, I ate some tteokbokki.

246
00:09:49.895 --> 00:09:51.995
- You studied while eating. - And then...

247
00:09:52.196 --> 00:09:53.796
I studied so I can eat.

248
00:09:54.066 --> 00:09:56.936
After that, I went to the institute and ate some snacks there.

249
00:09:56.936 --> 00:09:58.505
When I came home, I ate dinner.

250
00:09:58.505 --> 00:10:01.475
I repeated this diet for a long time,

251
00:10:02.036 --> 00:10:03.946
so I got fat in every part of body.

252
00:10:04.546 --> 00:10:06.046
- In every part. - You must've looked strong.

253
00:10:06.046 --> 00:10:11.515
When I was in high school, I looked like two celebrities.

254
00:10:11.515 --> 00:10:14.416
- Who are they? - Actor Sohn Chang Min...

255
00:10:14.416 --> 00:10:16.156
and Basketball Player Moon Kyung Eun.

256
00:10:16.985 --> 00:10:19.385
People said I looked like them so many times.

257
00:10:19.385 --> 00:10:21.625
I also had wide shoulders back then.

258
00:10:21.625 --> 00:10:24.525
So I heard I looked like male celebrities.

259
00:10:25.525 --> 00:10:27.836
However, the problem was...

260
00:10:28.895 --> 00:10:31.235
- that I didn't realize I was fat. - But you looked like Chang Min.

261
00:10:31.605 --> 00:10:33.836
I know. Since my friends told me that I was cute,

262
00:10:33.836 --> 00:10:36.375
I thought I was really cute.

263
00:10:37.046 --> 00:10:39.875
I didn't realize that I was fat.

264
00:10:39.875 --> 00:10:42.115
But when I turned 20,

265
00:10:42.316 --> 00:10:44.745
I wanted to become a celebrity.

266
00:10:44.745 --> 00:10:46.416
So I started working out hard.

267
00:10:46.416 --> 00:10:49.156
I worked out for three hours every day.

268
00:10:49.725 --> 00:10:51.725
I had eaten a lot before then,

269
00:10:51.725 --> 00:10:54.156
but I started eating only two meals per day.

270
00:10:54.156 --> 00:10:55.196
That's unbelievable.

271
00:10:55.196 --> 00:10:57.125
Did you reduce the amount of food to eat in every meal?

272
00:10:57.296 --> 00:10:59.735
Yes, I did. I reduced by half.

273
00:10:59.735 --> 00:11:01.466
I ate only half what I used to eat.

274
00:11:02.336 --> 00:11:04.635
(She deserves the recognition.)

275
00:11:04.635 --> 00:11:06.206
I heard my stomach making noise...

276
00:11:06.206 --> 00:11:08.735
for the 1st time in my life after I turned 20.

277
00:11:09.645 --> 00:11:12.605
I fell asleep while listening to the sound like a lullaby.

278
00:11:12.605 --> 00:11:14.375
- It sounded like a lullaby? - Yes.

279
00:11:14.375 --> 00:11:16.586
If you fall asleep with your stomach empty,

280
00:11:16.586 --> 00:11:19.186
you would feel something you've never felt in the morning.

281
00:11:19.816 --> 00:11:22.015
I feel ashamed to say this,

282
00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:24.125
but I haven't felt refreshed in the morning in my life.

283
00:11:24.755 --> 00:11:26.426
- How do you feel when you wake up? - I feel...

284
00:11:26.426 --> 00:11:28.495
(Every morning, he feels...)

285
00:11:29.125 --> 00:11:30.595
(His stomach is still full.)

286
00:11:31.326 --> 00:11:33.135
(I'd like to feel refreshed too.)

287
00:11:33.135 --> 00:11:35.536
There are famous quotes by women who succeeded in losing weight.

288
00:11:35.536 --> 00:11:36.566
Tell us.

289
00:11:36.566 --> 00:11:39.206
Kim Sa Rang said, "Eat three meals a day, and you'll get fat."

290
00:11:39.605 --> 00:11:42.336
Oak Joo Hyun said, "I already know how it tastes."

291
00:11:42.906 --> 00:11:45.345
- There's also a quote by Soo Kyung. - What is it?

292
00:11:45.946 --> 00:11:47.676
- Tell us. - I said,

293
00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:50.046
"Eat like a carnivorous animal."

294
00:11:50.745 --> 00:11:51.946
I don't like it.

295
00:11:52.416 --> 00:11:53.916
I don't understand it at all.

296
00:11:54.316 --> 00:11:56.556
- What are you talking about? - Listen to me carefully.

297
00:11:56.556 --> 00:11:57.556
If you eat grass...

298
00:11:57.556 --> 00:11:58.686
(Lee Soo Kyung, a carnivorous diet specialist)

299
00:11:58.686 --> 00:12:01.395
as much as a whole tree,

300
00:12:01.995 --> 00:12:03.166
it wouldn't help to lose weight.

301
00:12:03.495 --> 00:12:06.936
Carnivorous animals eat just as much as they need.

302
00:12:07.166 --> 00:12:09.395
They stop eating when they're full.

303
00:12:10.105 --> 00:12:12.306
They don't eat until they feel hungry again.

304
00:12:12.306 --> 00:12:13.306
And they keep moving.

305
00:12:13.306 --> 00:12:15.206
So what's your point?

306
00:12:15.206 --> 00:12:16.206
What's your point?

307
00:12:16.206 --> 00:12:17.345
(He stopped her meat diet lesson.)

308
00:12:17.345 --> 00:12:18.446
What's your point?

309
00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:20.916
I mean, humans live on a mixed diet.

310
00:12:21.546 --> 00:12:22.576
That's right.

311
00:12:22.576 --> 00:12:25.416
I suggest you should live like a carnivorous animal.

312
00:12:26.015 --> 00:12:29.186
You should eat, move, and live like a carnivorous animal.

313
00:12:29.186 --> 00:12:30.885
- But while eating... - She's right about that.

314
00:12:30.885 --> 00:12:32.995
- I once went to see pandas. - I see.

315
00:12:33.125 --> 00:12:34.956
I saw a panda moving around and exclaimed.

316
00:12:34.956 --> 00:12:36.296
I heard it's a very rare opportunity to see it.

317
00:12:37.066 --> 00:12:39.095
- They rarely move around. - They keep eating all day long.

318
00:12:39.095 --> 00:12:40.936
They just eat bamboo while sitting down all day long.

319
00:12:41.895 --> 00:12:43.365
- He looks like a panda. - Look at him.

320
00:12:43.365 --> 00:12:44.865
- There's a panda. - He described it well.

321
00:12:45.206 --> 00:12:47.306
(Sae Ho, I think you lost some weight.)

322
00:12:47.306 --> 00:12:49.775
(The panda brothers are on a picnic.)

323
00:12:49.906 --> 00:12:52.275
Imagine yourself lying down and eating all day long.

324
00:12:52.275 --> 00:12:55.446
Your body may change like a panda's or elephant's.

325
00:12:55.446 --> 00:12:58.546
But it's just how they look. It's not that they're fat.

326
00:12:58.546 --> 00:13:00.755
- That's how they survive. - They need it to survive.

327
00:13:00.755 --> 00:13:03.586
For example, they need to eat a lot before hibernating.

328
00:13:03.586 --> 00:13:05.286
Your theory is...

329
00:13:05.286 --> 00:13:07.895
quite convincing, but it's also a bit clumsy somehow.

330
00:13:07.895 --> 00:13:09.456
We can't be sure...

331
00:13:09.456 --> 00:13:10.765
Now that you've heard...

332
00:13:10.765 --> 00:13:12.426
Soo Kyung must be taken aback.

333
00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:13.696
Wait a minute.

334
00:13:13.696 --> 00:13:14.765
(She licked her lips.)

335
00:13:14.765 --> 00:13:16.536
I saw Soo Kyung doing this...

336
00:13:16.536 --> 00:13:18.906
since we couldn't seem to understand what she said.

337
00:13:18.906 --> 00:13:20.235
- I was anxious. - She licked her lips like this.

338
00:13:20.235 --> 00:13:22.906
- It's because you had a point. - I see.

339
00:13:22.946 --> 00:13:25.005
How do you eat meat?

340
00:13:25.005 --> 00:13:27.176
I eat meat with no salt or any kind of condiment.

341
00:13:27.176 --> 00:13:28.245
- Really? - Yes.

342
00:13:28.245 --> 00:13:29.275
Do you eat boiled meat?

343
00:13:29.275 --> 00:13:31.985
I eat boiled or grilled meat.

344
00:13:31.985 --> 00:13:34.015
- But you eat it without salt? - No other condiment?

345
00:13:34.015 --> 00:13:35.586
- You don't eat much marinated meat. - I don't eat marinated meat.

346
00:13:35.586 --> 00:13:36.686
When you eat,

347
00:13:36.686 --> 00:13:39.225
- you crave other food. - Exactly.

348
00:13:39.225 --> 00:13:41.395
- Like doenjang jjigae, - And naengmyeon.

349
00:13:41.395 --> 00:13:43.265
- naengmyeon, - Of course.

350
00:13:43.265 --> 00:13:44.666
and grilled kimchi.

351
00:13:44.895 --> 00:13:48.566
You think it's a natural reaction because you're used to it.

352
00:13:48.566 --> 00:13:51.005
People who have been eating like me think my diet is natural.

353
00:13:52.975 --> 00:13:54.936
But you have tasted all the condiments.

354
00:13:54.936 --> 00:13:57.505
- That's right. - I'm sorry, but... Soo Kyung.

355
00:13:57.576 --> 00:14:00.345
It's not that you ate food without salt your whole life.

356
00:14:00.345 --> 00:14:02.816
- I mean, - You're smacking your lips again.

357
00:14:02.816 --> 00:14:03.816
what do you want us to do?

358
00:14:03.816 --> 00:14:05.985
- You've tasted condiments. - I have to keep fit,

359
00:14:05.985 --> 00:14:07.186
so I keep a strict diet.

360
00:14:07.186 --> 00:14:10.755
If you tell yourself it tastes good, the food actually tastes good.

361
00:14:11.625 --> 00:14:13.225
- Only by thinking that? - We have to control our mind?

362
00:14:13.225 --> 00:14:14.355
Controlling your mind is very important.

363
00:14:14.355 --> 00:14:18.365
One day, Soo Kyung came over to my house with her dogs.

364
00:14:18.365 --> 00:14:19.796
She brought some bread and said it's good.

365
00:14:20.265 --> 00:14:21.336
It was too sweet.

366
00:14:21.696 --> 00:14:22.765
What was that?

367
00:14:23.005 --> 00:14:25.206
- Was it too sweet for you? - It was too sweet.

368
00:14:25.765 --> 00:14:26.806
I thought my blood sugar level would go up.

369
00:14:27.775 --> 00:14:29.436
Can't you feel the sweet taste?

370
00:14:29.436 --> 00:14:32.005
I stopped eating after three bites. It was too sweet.

371
00:14:32.005 --> 00:14:33.316
I'm sorry, but you might get arrested.

372
00:14:33.316 --> 00:14:34.316
(A fake diet guru)

373
00:14:34.316 --> 00:14:36.686
- What is it you want to say? - I...

374
00:14:36.686 --> 00:14:39.216
I keep a strict diet when losing weight.

375
00:14:39.216 --> 00:14:41.086
But in fact, I like dessert.

376
00:14:41.086 --> 00:14:42.115
Dessert?

377
00:14:42.316 --> 00:14:43.985
- She likes sweets so much. - I understand.

378
00:14:43.985 --> 00:14:47.125
Why don't you eat fewer sweets and eat a bit of salt instead?

379
00:14:47.125 --> 00:14:48.225
That's right.

380
00:14:48.225 --> 00:14:50.566
I have childish food preferences.

381
00:14:50.895 --> 00:14:52.566
I couldn't seem to give up on sweets.

382
00:14:52.566 --> 00:14:53.696
She's not consistent at all.

383
00:14:53.696 --> 00:14:55.666
I also like chocolate.

384
00:14:56.336 --> 00:14:57.436
More importantly,

385
00:14:57.436 --> 00:14:59.576
Se Jeong reacted enthusiastically. I think she can relate to that.

386
00:14:59.576 --> 00:15:01.806
- Yes, I can relate to that. - That's why I like Se Jeong.

387
00:15:01.806 --> 00:15:03.076
- You know what I mean. - Yes.

388
00:15:03.076 --> 00:15:04.845
- Se Jeong likes to eat too. - Do you agree with her?

389
00:15:04.845 --> 00:15:07.316
- I like to eat food so much. - I see.

390
00:15:07.316 --> 00:15:09.816
- I need to lose weight sometimes. - You have no choice.

391
00:15:09.816 --> 00:15:11.786
The problem is...

392
00:15:11.786 --> 00:15:14.855
that I can't maintain the weight. I always gain weight again soon.

393
00:15:14.885 --> 00:15:17.255
I recently gained weight again after losing weight.

394
00:15:18.355 --> 00:15:21.525
- I got a little fat on my cheeks. - She's quite honest.

395
00:15:21.525 --> 00:15:22.595
I once...

396
00:15:22.595 --> 00:15:25.426
lost 4kg in only 1 week.

397
00:15:25.426 --> 00:15:26.836
- In one week? - How is that possible?

398
00:15:26.836 --> 00:15:27.836
- That's not good for your health. - Did you just not eat?

399
00:15:27.836 --> 00:15:30.635
- I simply starved myself. - That's really bad.

400
00:15:30.635 --> 00:15:31.666
That's not good.

401
00:15:31.666 --> 00:15:34.005
I was so satisfied when I got to my lowest weight.

402
00:15:34.005 --> 00:15:35.936
- But then I gained 6kg. - That's right.

403
00:15:36.775 --> 00:15:38.005
It happens so quickly.

404
00:15:38.275 --> 00:15:40.216
- You lost 4kg and gained 6kg. - Yes.

405
00:15:40.216 --> 00:15:43.546
After I gained 6kg, the 1st digit of my weight changed.

406
00:15:43.546 --> 00:15:45.786
Since the first digit changed,

407
00:15:45.786 --> 00:15:49.355
I feel like it was out of control.

408
00:15:49.355 --> 00:15:50.426
You just want to give up in that situation.

409
00:15:50.426 --> 00:15:53.755
- I would've tried not to gain more, - "Whatever. I give up."

410
00:15:53.755 --> 00:15:55.826
but I couldn't seem to stop gaining weight.

411
00:15:55.826 --> 00:15:58.796
After I got to my heaviest point,

412
00:15:58.796 --> 00:16:01.966
it became normal to me that the first digit changes.

413
00:16:01.966 --> 00:16:04.265
I found her so adorable. We have dinner together...

414
00:16:04.265 --> 00:16:07.576
after finishing recording "The Law of Jungle".

415
00:16:07.576 --> 00:16:10.145
We ordered a lot of food, but Se Jeong said,

416
00:16:10.145 --> 00:16:12.845
"I shouldn't eat this because I'll make a comeback as a singer."

417
00:16:12.845 --> 00:16:14.916
We suggested one more time just to be polite.

418
00:16:14.916 --> 00:16:16.916
- While you were in the jungle? - We thought she would refuse it.

419
00:16:16.916 --> 00:16:18.485
We said, "Se Jeong, you should eat at least one bite."

420
00:16:18.485 --> 00:16:21.485
She said, "Then shall I eat?" Then she ate with us.

421
00:16:21.956 --> 00:16:24.125
(A shocking twist)

422
00:16:24.926 --> 00:16:27.125
- She's adorable. - I understand.

423
00:16:27.125 --> 00:16:28.595
She had no choice.

424
00:16:28.595 --> 00:16:30.826
I heard you can drink a lot.

425
00:16:31.125 --> 00:16:33.466
I don't drink very often,

426
00:16:33.466 --> 00:16:36.135
but once I start drinking, I go all the way.

427
00:16:36.135 --> 00:16:37.235
Is that so?

428
00:16:37.235 --> 00:16:39.365
I start drinking in the afternoon...

429
00:16:39.936 --> 00:16:42.475
and drink until late night.

430
00:16:42.475 --> 00:16:44.005
You know you shouldn't pause while drinking.

431
00:16:44.475 --> 00:16:45.605
Can you drink that much?

432
00:16:46.105 --> 00:16:49.316
While drinking little by little, at some point,

433
00:16:49.316 --> 00:16:51.186
- I see a lot of empty bottles... - They piled up on the table.

434
00:16:51.186 --> 00:16:53.255
piling up on the table behind me.

435
00:16:53.255 --> 00:16:55.316
- How much can you drink? - She's amazing.

436
00:16:55.316 --> 00:16:58.255
I don't think she suits a diet queen.

437
00:16:58.255 --> 00:16:59.595
Shouldn't she avoid drinking out of everything?

438
00:16:59.595 --> 00:17:01.625
I mean, Soo Kyung is...

439
00:17:01.625 --> 00:17:04.765
She's hard to... I don't know about her.

440
00:17:04.765 --> 00:17:06.335
It's not too late. Tell us...

441
00:17:06.765 --> 00:17:09.936
She sounds like a diet expert, but...

442
00:17:09.936 --> 00:17:11.835
She likes drinks and sweets.

443
00:17:11.835 --> 00:17:13.436
I think she needs a new concept.

444
00:17:13.436 --> 00:17:15.535
(She needs a new concept right away.)

445
00:17:16.005 --> 00:17:18.575
Bo Reum, you can hold your liquor too.

446
00:17:18.575 --> 00:17:20.176
When we used to drink a lot,

447
00:17:20.275 --> 00:17:23.485
we left a restaurant because it had run out of liquor.

448
00:17:23.916 --> 00:17:25.315
You left a restaurant because it had run out of liquor.

449
00:17:25.315 --> 00:17:27.985
- The liquor they keep... - Don't they let you buy it outside?

450
00:17:27.985 --> 00:17:29.186
They do, but...

451
00:17:29.186 --> 00:17:30.186
(Why are you cutting in?)

452
00:17:30.985 --> 00:17:33.055
Why would you buy liquor outside when you are on a diet?

453
00:17:33.055 --> 00:17:35.626
- I guess it has happened to you. - You know,

454
00:17:35.626 --> 00:17:36.966
you are going to ruin your health.

455
00:17:36.966 --> 00:17:38.426
Your words don't add up.

456
00:17:38.426 --> 00:17:40.096
You need to decide on your concept.

457
00:17:40.866 --> 00:17:43.335
It happens only when I decide to drink a lot.

458
00:17:43.335 --> 00:17:44.406
Just how much do you drink?

459
00:17:44.406 --> 00:17:45.505
You finish off a restaurant and buy more alcohol outside.

460
00:17:45.505 --> 00:17:46.975
Yes, we move on to the next restaurant.

461
00:17:46.975 --> 00:17:48.575
- The next restaurant. - That's right.

462
00:17:48.575 --> 00:17:51.446
- Really? - Then we drink everything there is.

463
00:17:51.876 --> 00:17:53.075
We start during the day.

464
00:17:53.075 --> 00:17:54.475
- During the day? - We start during the day.

465
00:17:54.475 --> 00:17:55.475
- Yes. - During the day?

466
00:17:55.475 --> 00:17:57.146
- As early as possible. - We are on the same page.

467
00:17:57.146 --> 00:17:58.686
It's the best to start drinking during the day.

468
00:18:01.255 --> 00:18:03.386
Soo Kyung, you have a special massage technique.

469
00:18:03.386 --> 00:18:04.426
What is it?

470
00:18:04.426 --> 00:18:06.426
- I... - Does it reduce bloating?

471
00:18:06.426 --> 00:18:09.426
You can use plastic wrap or a ball...

472
00:18:09.426 --> 00:18:10.896
- for a massage. - Is that a thief?

473
00:18:10.896 --> 00:18:12.795
I heard this is my role of the day.

474
00:18:13.735 --> 00:18:17.606
I will teach you how you can grow 0.5cm a day.

475
00:18:17.606 --> 00:18:18.666
- Really? - Yes.

476
00:18:18.666 --> 00:18:20.235
- Really? - Really?

477
00:18:20.235 --> 00:18:21.575
I really need to know that.

478
00:18:21.575 --> 00:18:22.676
It's nice.

479
00:18:22.846 --> 00:18:24.206
I want to know too.

480
00:18:24.206 --> 00:18:27.575
We need a towel or plastic wrap.

481
00:18:27.575 --> 00:18:28.676
Please lie down.

482
00:18:29.216 --> 00:18:31.085
- You need to measure his height. - Right, the current height.

483
00:18:31.085 --> 00:18:32.745
- I have no intention of doing it. - Shall we measure it?

484
00:18:34.555 --> 00:18:36.755
(I won't participate.)

485
00:18:37.785 --> 00:18:38.926
(It frustrates him more...)

486
00:18:38.926 --> 00:18:40.555
(than a weather forecaster mission.)

487
00:18:41.696 --> 00:18:44.896
(He is suddenly asked to measure his height.)

488
00:18:44.896 --> 00:18:46.436
- I mean... - Sae Ho is puzzled.

489
00:18:46.436 --> 00:18:47.666
That's incredible.

490
00:18:47.835 --> 00:18:49.096
This is sudden.

491
00:18:49.265 --> 00:18:51.166
That measures the weight.

492
00:18:51.305 --> 00:18:52.535
- That measures the weight. - No way.

493
00:18:52.535 --> 00:18:53.535
(Here come a stadiometer and a weight.)

494
00:18:53.535 --> 00:18:54.606
I won't reveal my weight.

495
00:18:54.606 --> 00:18:56.876
I thought he was Kim Tae Ho for a second.

496
00:18:58.305 --> 00:19:00.876
(Kim Tae Ho as a special guest in Happy Together?)

497
00:19:01.045 --> 00:19:02.946
I wondered if he works part-time on this set.

498
00:19:03.985 --> 00:19:05.616
I thought he was Kim Tae Ho for a second.

499
00:19:05.616 --> 00:19:06.755
- Seriously. - He's blushing.

500
00:19:07.186 --> 00:19:10.126
- As for my weight, - It can be blurred out.

501
00:19:10.126 --> 00:19:12.186
- my pants are heavy. - All right.

502
00:19:12.186 --> 00:19:13.596
We covered the weight.

503
00:19:13.596 --> 00:19:15.356
Really? It's a good idea.

504
00:19:15.356 --> 00:19:17.166
- We minded our manners. - Okay.

505
00:19:17.166 --> 00:19:19.096
I am 169cm tall.

506
00:19:20.636 --> 00:19:22.906
(He aims for 169cm.)

507
00:19:24.235 --> 00:19:26.275
- 169cm. - Why do you need to mention it?

508
00:19:26.735 --> 00:19:28.376
He is straightening his neck.

509
00:19:28.475 --> 00:19:29.545
It's going down.

510
00:19:29.545 --> 00:19:30.876
He is straightening his neck.

511
00:19:30.876 --> 00:19:32.545
(The headpiece is going down.)

512
00:19:33.146 --> 00:19:35.015
(What's the result?)

513
00:19:35.015 --> 00:19:37.285
- You are 167.5cm tall. - Is he shorter than me?

514
00:19:37.285 --> 00:19:38.485
He's become shorter.

515
00:19:38.785 --> 00:19:40.186
Don't say that.

516
00:19:40.656 --> 00:19:42.616
- Am I 167.5cm tall? - You didn't know your own height.

517
00:19:42.616 --> 00:19:43.886
Let me measure my height one more time.

518
00:19:43.886 --> 00:19:45.456
He wants to measure his height one more time.

519
00:19:45.456 --> 00:19:46.995
- I am 168cm tall. - Nothing will change.

520
00:19:46.995 --> 00:19:48.456
- He is straightening his neck. - Something seems to be off.

521
00:19:48.456 --> 00:19:49.456
Let's try it again.

522
00:19:50.166 --> 00:19:51.495
Watch his heels.

523
00:19:51.495 --> 00:19:53.366
- Come on, Sae Ho. - Don't do that.

524
00:19:54.196 --> 00:19:55.335
He is triple-chinned.

525
00:19:55.335 --> 00:19:56.805
(His triple chin shows his desperation.)

526
00:19:57.005 --> 00:19:58.206
He is triple-chinned.

527
00:19:58.235 --> 00:20:00.035
(I will succeed this time.)

528
00:20:00.906 --> 00:20:01.936
Don't stand on tiptoe.

529
00:20:01.936 --> 00:20:02.975
(What will be the result...)

530
00:20:02.975 --> 00:20:04.575
(this time around?)

531
00:20:04.706 --> 00:20:06.346
- 167cm. - What?

532
00:20:07.346 --> 00:20:08.815
(Maybe you read it wrong.)

533
00:20:08.815 --> 00:20:10.015
167cm.

534
00:20:10.015 --> 00:20:11.085
(No.)

535
00:20:11.186 --> 00:20:13.386
- Sae Ho, you are shrinking. - 167.5cm is correct.

536
00:20:13.386 --> 00:20:15.085
- Sae Ho. - It was 167.5cm earlier, right?

537
00:20:15.085 --> 00:20:16.186
You are shrinking.

538
00:20:16.186 --> 00:20:17.255
- No way. - 167cm.

539
00:20:17.255 --> 00:20:18.626
(He loses his mind.)

540
00:20:18.755 --> 00:20:19.795
Shall we measure it one more time?

541
00:20:20.055 --> 00:20:22.255
Really? No, I am okay.

542
00:20:22.255 --> 00:20:23.325
(I lost my confidence.)

543
00:20:23.325 --> 00:20:24.926
What are you going to do?

544
00:20:24.926 --> 00:20:26.866
- I will use the earlier measure. - What are you going to do?

545
00:20:26.866 --> 00:20:28.265
- 167.5cm. - Measure it one last time.

546
00:20:28.265 --> 00:20:29.335
- Are you sure? - One last time!

547
00:20:29.866 --> 00:20:30.966
(Forget it.)

548
00:20:30.966 --> 00:20:32.065
- I will use this measurement. - Okay.

549
00:20:32.436 --> 00:20:33.636
What's wrong with this device?

550
00:20:33.636 --> 00:20:35.376
This is your last chance.

551
00:20:35.376 --> 00:20:36.946
- I am not in a good condition. - Stand straight.

552
00:20:36.946 --> 00:20:38.545
- This is your last chance. - Stand like you did at first.

553
00:20:38.545 --> 00:20:39.775
We thought you would be taller.

554
00:20:39.775 --> 00:20:41.475
This is the first time I have watched a height show.

555
00:20:41.716 --> 00:20:44.515
When you have your height measured,

556
00:20:44.515 --> 00:20:46.555
- suck in your stomach. - That's right.

557
00:20:46.555 --> 00:20:47.886
- Do this... - That's good.

558
00:20:47.886 --> 00:20:48.956
for a better result.

559
00:20:49.285 --> 00:20:51.985
He is showing us the miracle of the shrinking height.

560
00:20:51.985 --> 00:20:53.426
- Don't stick out your chest. - It's a magic show.

561
00:20:53.995 --> 00:20:56.166
(This is...)

562
00:20:56.166 --> 00:20:57.896
(the last chance.)

563
00:20:58.825 --> 00:21:00.735
(Will he be able...)

564
00:21:00.735 --> 00:21:03.035
(to grow taller?)

565
00:21:03.966 --> 00:21:05.535
(His heart pounds.)

566
00:21:07.075 --> 00:21:09.005
(The result will be revealed.)

567
00:21:09.376 --> 00:21:11.245
- Watch your heel. - That's good.

568
00:21:11.245 --> 00:21:12.676
- Okay. - 166.5cm.

569
00:21:13.676 --> 00:21:15.515
- What is wrong with this device? - It's fascinating.

570
00:21:16.116 --> 00:21:17.515
(I don't lie.)

571
00:21:18.216 --> 00:21:19.346
(He feels wronged.)

572
00:21:19.346 --> 00:21:21.216
Is this a device that shrinks people's height?

573
00:21:21.916 --> 00:21:23.456
(Begging)

574
00:21:23.785 --> 00:21:26.156
- What happened? - 167.5cm.

575
00:21:26.356 --> 00:21:28.525
- 167.5cm. - What? 167.5cm?

576
00:21:28.525 --> 00:21:30.396
- Let's say I am 167.5cm. - Let's come up with an average.

577
00:21:30.396 --> 00:21:32.765
- Let's come up with an average. - Let's do that.

578
00:21:32.765 --> 00:21:34.295
Would you stay out of this?

579
00:21:34.696 --> 00:21:36.765
This is an important moment of my life.

580
00:21:37.636 --> 00:21:38.906
This is an important moment of my life.

581
00:21:38.906 --> 00:21:40.406
Sae Ho,

582
00:21:40.406 --> 00:21:42.575
- let's go with 167cm. - Go with 167cm.

583
00:21:42.575 --> 00:21:44.075
- That's right. - On my profile,

584
00:21:44.075 --> 00:21:45.975
I am 172cm tall.

585
00:21:46.775 --> 00:21:47.846
No way.

586
00:21:48.216 --> 00:21:51.485
- On my profile, I am 172cm tall. - Then let's go with 167.5cm.

587
00:21:51.485 --> 00:21:52.485
167.5cm.

588
00:21:52.485 --> 00:21:53.585
- Soo Kyung. - Yes?

589
00:21:53.585 --> 00:21:55.186
- You can make him taller. - Yes.

590
00:21:55.186 --> 00:21:56.386
It's fascinating.

591
00:21:56.656 --> 00:22:00.426
Many people have hunched backs.

592
00:22:00.426 --> 00:22:02.396
- Please lie down. - I have a hunched back.

593
00:22:02.396 --> 00:22:05.126
- You need about five minutes. - Many are like that.

594
00:22:05.126 --> 00:22:08.065
- Lift your hip a little. - I see what she is doing.

595
00:22:08.065 --> 00:22:09.765
It straightens out your spine.

596
00:22:09.765 --> 00:22:11.166
- Yes, it does. - It straightens out your back.

597
00:22:11.166 --> 00:22:13.706
- Stretch your legs. - It feels like...

598
00:22:13.706 --> 00:22:15.005
"AM Plaza".

599
00:22:15.406 --> 00:22:16.706
Keep your legs together.

600
00:22:16.706 --> 00:22:18.376
Imagine your body stretching.

601
00:22:18.376 --> 00:22:20.876
- Soo Kyung is like a doctor. - Raise your arms.

602
00:22:20.876 --> 00:22:22.676
Stay in this position for five minutes.

603
00:22:22.676 --> 00:22:24.116
We will continue with the show.

604
00:22:24.446 --> 00:22:25.785
- It stretches him out. - Five minutes?

605
00:22:25.785 --> 00:22:27.716
- Five minutes. - Let's talk in the meanwhile.

606
00:22:28.386 --> 00:22:31.225
While you are stretching,

607
00:22:31.225 --> 00:22:33.995
we will move on with the talk...

608
00:22:33.995 --> 00:22:35.456
- to save up time. - Let's move on.

609
00:22:36.196 --> 00:22:37.825
- Hold on. - Let's move on with the talk.

610
00:22:37.825 --> 00:22:39.466
To see the result,

611
00:22:39.466 --> 00:22:42.196
Sae Ho will stretch for five minutes.

612
00:22:42.196 --> 00:22:44.065
The tip of his feet shows desperation.

613
00:22:44.065 --> 00:22:46.936
We can't stare at him for five minutes.

614
00:22:46.936 --> 00:22:49.176
This is my first time seeing the ceiling of the KBS building.

615
00:22:50.606 --> 00:22:52.005
That's what it looks like.

616
00:22:53.275 --> 00:22:57.386
Se Jeong is known as the fairy of eating shows.

617
00:22:57.386 --> 00:23:00.456
Seeing you enjoy your food stimulates the appetite.

618
00:23:00.456 --> 00:23:02.656
I lived with my brother...

619
00:23:02.656 --> 00:23:03.785
- when I was young. - I see.

620
00:23:03.785 --> 00:23:05.886
I am impatient,

621
00:23:05.886 --> 00:23:08.825
and my brother is gluttonous.

622
00:23:08.825 --> 00:23:11.396
When there is food, I eat a lot in a short amount of time...

623
00:23:11.396 --> 00:23:13.265
- because I feel impatient. - You've got to be quick.

624
00:23:13.265 --> 00:23:16.936
When there are noodles, I mix them like this...

625
00:23:16.936 --> 00:23:18.535
- before eating. - He might take yours as well.

626
00:23:18.535 --> 00:23:21.206
When there is rice, I scoop it like this.

627
00:23:21.206 --> 00:23:24.545
People think, "She is enjoying her food."

628
00:23:24.545 --> 00:23:26.075
"It must be delicious."

629
00:23:26.075 --> 00:23:28.346
It will be crazy if you eat a fried chicken with your brother.

630
00:23:28.346 --> 00:23:29.485
That's right.

631
00:23:29.716 --> 00:23:31.985
When my brother and I order deliveries,

632
00:23:31.985 --> 00:23:35.416
we always get a pizza and two fried chicken.

633
00:23:35.416 --> 00:23:36.555
- Really? - For two people?

634
00:23:36.555 --> 00:23:37.626
- Yes. - That's a lot of food.

635
00:23:37.626 --> 00:23:39.525
- That's a lot. - That's really a lot.

636
00:23:39.525 --> 00:23:42.825
We always order pizza with a diameter of 50cm.

637
00:23:42.825 --> 00:23:44.065
- Large. - The biggest one.

638
00:23:44.065 --> 00:23:47.396
We prefer having leftovers over being hungry.

639
00:23:47.696 --> 00:23:50.235
- That's incredible. - For a second, I thought,

640
00:23:50.235 --> 00:23:52.265
"Why is this man lying in the middle of a studio?"

641
00:23:53.235 --> 00:23:54.975
He is making money in an easy way.

642
00:23:55.075 --> 00:23:57.505
I feel like I am listening to a radio program.

643
00:23:58.005 --> 00:24:00.176
- The time is up. - That's right.

644
00:24:00.176 --> 00:24:01.916
- I'm curious. - I am nervous.

645
00:24:01.916 --> 00:24:02.985
(Creaking)

646
00:24:03.346 --> 00:24:05.616
If... If...

647
00:24:05.616 --> 00:24:06.985
- He needs to remove it first. - Are you okay?

648
00:24:06.985 --> 00:24:09.186
If his height becomes 169cm, it will be incredible.

649
00:24:09.186 --> 00:24:10.225
- Of course. - Right.

650
00:24:10.555 --> 00:24:12.156
Then everyone will try this.

651
00:24:12.456 --> 00:24:14.126
- It was refreshing, right? - He became taller!

652
00:24:14.126 --> 00:24:15.795
- He became taller! - My goodness.

653
00:24:15.795 --> 00:24:16.926
Really?

654
00:24:16.926 --> 00:24:18.426
- 172cm. - He did become taller.

655
00:24:18.426 --> 00:24:20.535
- Measure his height. - He became taller.

656
00:24:20.535 --> 00:24:21.795
- He became taller. - Seriously.

657
00:24:21.795 --> 00:24:23.636
- Measure it before he shrinks. - Press the button.

658
00:24:25.265 --> 00:24:27.475
(How effective is the massage?)

659
00:24:27.475 --> 00:24:29.275
- How tall is he now? - Press it.

660
00:24:30.906 --> 00:24:31.975
How tall is he?

661
00:24:32.676 --> 00:24:34.346
(I am serious.)

662
00:24:35.575 --> 00:24:37.045
(The height on his profile is 172cm.)

663
00:24:37.045 --> 00:24:39.045
(Will he be able to make it true?)

664
00:24:40.285 --> 00:24:41.716
(What's his height after the massage?)

665
00:24:41.716 --> 00:24:44.085
- 167.6cm. - 167.6cm.

666
00:24:44.426 --> 00:24:45.456
He became taller.

667
00:24:45.456 --> 00:24:47.255
- What? - 167.6cm.

668
00:24:47.255 --> 00:24:48.255
167.6cm.

669
00:24:48.255 --> 00:24:49.866
- Sae Ho. - He is 0.5cm taller.

670
00:24:49.866 --> 00:24:51.096
- He became taller. - He gained...

671
00:24:51.096 --> 00:24:53.666
0.1cm compared to the first measurement.

672
00:24:53.666 --> 00:24:55.136
- I think... - Also...

673
00:24:55.136 --> 00:24:56.936
I became 0.4cm taller.

674
00:24:57.535 --> 00:24:59.436
- Really? - Are you revealing the true height?

675
00:25:00.275 --> 00:25:02.975
167.5cm was more than I expected.

676
00:25:04.346 --> 00:25:05.446
It really worked.

677
00:25:05.446 --> 00:25:07.716
Soo Kyung, you were correct.

678
00:25:07.716 --> 00:25:10.985
It's a way to become 0.5cm taller in 5 minutes.

679
00:25:10.985 --> 00:25:14.186
- Good job. - When I stand straight,

680
00:25:15.585 --> 00:25:17.426
I can tell that my eye level is different.

681
00:25:17.525 --> 00:25:20.156
Your eye level won't change with 0.5cm.

682
00:25:20.156 --> 00:25:21.926
- Seriously. - Maybe you're looking upward.

683
00:25:21.926 --> 00:25:23.495
- You didn't become that tall. - No?

684
00:25:23.495 --> 00:25:25.466
You didn't become that tall. Shall we measure the height again?

685
00:25:25.466 --> 00:25:26.466
(Shall we measure it again?)

686
00:25:26.466 --> 00:25:28.065
- Shall we measure the height again? - The air feels different.

687
00:25:28.065 --> 00:25:30.005
You are just keeping your eyes at a higher place.

688
00:25:30.005 --> 00:25:31.606
(It feels different this time.)

689
00:25:32.505 --> 00:25:35.106
(He aims to set a world record.)

690
00:25:36.446 --> 00:25:38.146
(They focus their attention on him.)

691
00:25:39.346 --> 00:25:41.676
(Will Sae Ho's dream come true?)

692
00:25:44.085 --> 00:25:45.285
(The headpiece was cast.)

693
00:25:45.485 --> 00:25:46.985
It became 167cm.

694
00:25:47.856 --> 00:25:49.186
- That's your height. - Really?

695
00:25:50.126 --> 00:25:51.725
(It's exactly 167cm.)

696
00:25:51.926 --> 00:25:53.525
His height reverted back too soon.

697
00:25:54.025 --> 00:25:56.126
- What was that? - He should have done it longer.

698
00:25:56.126 --> 00:25:58.325
Make sure you update your profile.

699
00:25:59.666 --> 00:26:02.765
- Update it. - Who are you talking to?

700
00:26:02.835 --> 00:26:04.166
I don't know.

701
00:26:04.166 --> 00:26:07.575
Soo Kyung, I have a question for you.

702
00:26:07.575 --> 00:26:10.305
Have you tried the massage on yourself?

703
00:26:10.305 --> 00:26:11.575
- Of course I have. - Really?

704
00:26:11.575 --> 00:26:12.676
Was it effective?

705
00:26:12.676 --> 00:26:14.876
When my posture is bad,

706
00:26:14.876 --> 00:26:16.216
there is a big difference.

707
00:26:16.245 --> 00:26:17.285
(Doubtful)

708
00:26:17.846 --> 00:26:19.045
Try it.

709
00:26:19.045 --> 00:26:20.285
What's your height on your profile?

710
00:26:20.285 --> 00:26:22.616
I am 170cm tall.

711
00:26:22.686 --> 00:26:25.325
Back in the days, people didn't like tall women.

712
00:26:25.325 --> 00:26:26.555
That's why I wrote that I am shorter.

713
00:26:26.555 --> 00:26:28.356
It's opposite of what Sae Ho did.

714
00:26:28.356 --> 00:26:29.525
That's a luxury.

715
00:26:30.866 --> 00:26:32.896
- "Luxury". - A small luxury.

716
00:26:32.896 --> 00:26:34.436
- A small luxury. - A small luxury.

717
00:26:36.466 --> 00:26:38.005
I have a personal question.

718
00:26:38.005 --> 00:26:39.005
(It's for Hae Sun.)

719
00:26:39.005 --> 00:26:41.835
In "While You Were Sleeping",

720
00:26:41.835 --> 00:26:43.376
you worked with Lee Jong Suk.

721
00:26:43.376 --> 00:26:44.606
What is he like?

722
00:26:44.606 --> 00:26:46.346
It's her first question of the day.

723
00:26:46.346 --> 00:26:47.416
The first one today.

724
00:26:47.416 --> 00:26:49.815
He was more cheerful than I expected.

725
00:26:49.815 --> 00:26:51.646
I was careful...

726
00:26:51.646 --> 00:26:53.886
because I thought it would take long to become close to him.

727
00:26:53.886 --> 00:26:55.315
He has that vibe.

728
00:26:55.315 --> 00:26:58.025
However, he was more cheerful than I expected.

729
00:26:58.025 --> 00:27:01.325
He promised to come and watch my play...

730
00:27:01.525 --> 00:27:03.525
before the drama ended.

731
00:27:03.525 --> 00:27:05.795
I didn't think he meant his words, so I said,

732
00:27:05.795 --> 00:27:08.166
"Thank you. Come and see my play."

733
00:27:08.166 --> 00:27:11.906
The next day, he came to the ticket office...

734
00:27:12.136 --> 00:27:14.676
without a manager.

735
00:27:15.176 --> 00:27:18.676
Including Jung Hae In and Go Sung Hee,

736
00:27:18.676 --> 00:27:20.815
the team from "While You Were Sleeping" came.

737
00:27:20.815 --> 00:27:23.745
However, he came ahead of time on his own.

738
00:27:23.745 --> 00:27:27.785
- He bought the tickets. - He came to buy tickets as gifts.

739
00:27:27.785 --> 00:27:31.356
There was a ruckus because I didn't say who was coming.

740
00:27:32.156 --> 00:27:35.696
"Hae Sun, Lee Jong Suk is here!"

741
00:27:35.696 --> 00:27:37.265
They screamed.

742
00:27:37.265 --> 00:27:39.166
I told them to give him his tickets.

743
00:27:39.166 --> 00:27:42.335
After the performance, we ate something tasty.

744
00:27:42.466 --> 00:27:47.005
He invited the team to his cafe to talk, eat something tasty,

745
00:27:47.676 --> 00:27:49.275
- and play games. - That's sweet.

746
00:27:49.275 --> 00:27:51.446
He is the best.

747
00:27:51.446 --> 00:27:53.275
- Is he that sweet? - Yes.

748
00:27:53.346 --> 00:27:54.775
Se Jeong.

749
00:27:55.275 --> 00:27:57.545
Sae Ho helped you in the jungle,

750
00:27:57.545 --> 00:27:59.186
but you never called him sweet.

751
00:27:59.186 --> 00:28:01.886
- Tell me. Am I sweet? - He is chubby.

752
00:28:01.886 --> 00:28:03.085
He is nice.

753
00:28:03.085 --> 00:28:04.785
(I can speak of it now.)

754
00:28:05.055 --> 00:28:06.156
"He is nice."

755
00:28:06.156 --> 00:28:07.656
Sae Ho is nice...

756
00:28:07.656 --> 00:28:09.866
- and Lee Jong Suk is sweet. - He is sweet.

757
00:28:11.166 --> 00:28:13.765
Hyeon Gyeong will be jealous of you.

758
00:28:13.765 --> 00:28:17.466
You decided to star in a drama...

759
00:28:17.466 --> 00:28:19.835
upon hearing that you will play Cho Jung Seok's doctor.

760
00:28:19.835 --> 00:28:23.545
I was never in a musical with him,

761
00:28:23.545 --> 00:28:25.446
- but we used to be very close. - I see.

762
00:28:25.446 --> 00:28:29.946
That's why we promised each other to work together one day.

763
00:28:30.085 --> 00:28:33.956
The director of "Yong Pal" called me and said...

764
00:28:33.956 --> 00:28:37.186
he wants me to play Cho Jung Seok's doctor.

765
00:28:37.186 --> 00:28:39.825
I didn't look at the synopsis or inquire after anything.

766
00:28:40.156 --> 00:28:42.656
I simply said, "I will take the job. Okay, see you later."

767
00:28:43.065 --> 00:28:44.765
Then we met at the set.

768
00:28:44.795 --> 00:28:48.096
Jung Seok is bound to be successful.

769
00:28:48.235 --> 00:28:50.005
Despite his natural talent,

770
00:28:50.565 --> 00:28:52.106
he puts in a lot of effort.

771
00:28:52.636 --> 00:28:55.775
I haven't talked about this anywhere else.

772
00:28:56.106 --> 00:28:58.106
He wrote in an acting journal every day.

773
00:28:58.106 --> 00:29:00.916
- Really? - Not many actors do that.

774
00:29:01.376 --> 00:29:04.416
Every day, he wrote down the feelings after performance.

775
00:29:04.745 --> 00:29:06.686
- He wrote them down. - So that he wouldn't forget,

776
00:29:06.686 --> 00:29:08.785
- he wrote in the journal every day. - That's impressive.

777
00:29:08.785 --> 00:29:11.325
He didn't skip a day.

778
00:29:11.585 --> 00:29:13.956
That kind of effort made him who he is right now.

779
00:29:13.956 --> 00:29:16.025
As you see in his works,

780
00:29:16.166 --> 00:29:18.795
he is detailed, witty, and quick.

781
00:29:18.795 --> 00:29:21.196
He is a good actor who puts in a lot of effort.

782
00:29:21.196 --> 00:29:24.065
- He is cool. - I wanted to work with him.

783
00:29:24.065 --> 00:29:25.735
She is right. He is an incredible actor.

784
00:29:25.735 --> 00:29:28.275
- He is amazing. - When he says I can speak English,

785
00:29:28.275 --> 00:29:30.245
I feel like I really can. He is in a commercial.

786
00:29:30.245 --> 00:29:32.005
- It was tempting. - It was, right?

787
00:29:32.275 --> 00:29:33.616
- The commercial was tempting. - "You can do it."

788
00:29:33.616 --> 00:29:35.916
- "With us, you can do it." - "You can do it."

789
00:29:35.916 --> 00:29:37.245
"Me?"

790
00:29:37.245 --> 00:29:38.285
"Is he talking to me?"

791
00:29:38.285 --> 00:29:41.055
"You can do it, too." Really? Yes, I can.

792
00:29:41.716 --> 00:29:42.926
That's right.

793
00:29:43.485 --> 00:29:47.825
Soo Kyung, is there an actor who made your heart flutter?

794
00:29:47.825 --> 00:29:49.456
I remember...

795
00:29:49.456 --> 00:29:52.765
a unique experience.

796
00:29:52.765 --> 00:29:55.565
Back in the days, I starred in "The War of Flower"...

797
00:29:55.565 --> 00:29:58.866
alongside Jo Seung Woo.

798
00:29:59.065 --> 00:30:01.636
There was a scene...

799
00:30:02.176 --> 00:30:05.275
where I cut his hair.

800
00:30:05.275 --> 00:30:07.775
Then we kiss.

801
00:30:08.446 --> 00:30:11.186
Hair is a part of your body.

802
00:30:11.186 --> 00:30:14.085
Touching it...

803
00:30:14.085 --> 00:30:17.585
felt very romantic.

804
00:30:17.585 --> 00:30:19.995
My heart fluttered back then.

805
00:30:19.995 --> 00:30:20.995
- I see. - It still does.

806
00:30:21.356 --> 00:30:22.626
I can't forget it.

807
00:30:22.696 --> 00:30:25.696
Jo Seung Woo makes your heart flutter.

808
00:30:25.696 --> 00:30:26.936
- Do you have an experience? - That's right.

809
00:30:26.966 --> 00:30:29.436
We acted together once.

810
00:30:29.535 --> 00:30:32.666
I played a mother and he played the narrator.

811
00:30:32.666 --> 00:30:35.075
He came in and out of the musical like a ghost.

812
00:30:35.436 --> 00:30:39.376
I am not supposed to know about this narrator.

813
00:30:39.376 --> 00:30:41.775
However, seeing him act and sing by my side...

814
00:30:42.075 --> 00:30:44.545
made my heart flutter.

815
00:30:45.146 --> 00:30:47.386
- There was no romance between us. - That's amazing.

816
00:30:47.585 --> 00:30:49.585
- He is charming. - His presence...

817
00:30:49.585 --> 00:30:51.985
- It feels the space. - That's right.

818
00:30:51.985 --> 00:30:53.456
My heart fluttered.

819
00:30:53.456 --> 00:30:54.696
Maybe you are weak.

820
00:30:55.696 --> 00:30:57.295
Maybe you liked him.

821
00:30:57.765 --> 00:30:59.696
- You should get a checkup. - Maybe you liked him.

822
00:30:59.696 --> 00:31:01.666
You need magnesium.

823
00:31:02.166 --> 00:31:04.005
How about you, Se Jeong?

824
00:31:04.005 --> 00:31:08.535
He is someone I want to work with one day.

825
00:31:08.775 --> 00:31:12.346
The members of Gugudan really like Woo Do Hwan...

826
00:31:12.346 --> 00:31:14.545
- who starred in "Save Me". - Woo Do Hwan.

827
00:31:14.876 --> 00:31:17.846
When I received the Newcomer Award,

828
00:31:18.085 --> 00:31:19.886
- he sat next to me. - I see.

829
00:31:19.886 --> 00:31:22.585
- He was in a KBS drama. - To make the members jealous,

830
00:31:22.886 --> 00:31:26.055
I asked him to take a selfie with me.

831
00:31:26.255 --> 00:31:29.025
I uploaded the selfie in the group chat.

832
00:31:29.255 --> 00:31:31.166
Their reactions were frenzied.

833
00:31:31.166 --> 00:31:33.696
I received so many replies.

834
00:31:33.995 --> 00:31:35.466
I was so excited.

835
00:31:36.096 --> 00:31:40.176
I will receive a bigger reaction if I work with him,

836
00:31:40.176 --> 00:31:42.106
so I want to do it someday.

837
00:31:42.106 --> 00:31:44.805
You want to work with Woo Do Hwan...

838
00:31:44.805 --> 00:31:46.346
for the members' frenzied reactions.

839
00:31:46.416 --> 00:31:47.475
The group chat room will be shaken up.

840
00:31:47.475 --> 00:31:48.975
- You want that. - Yes.

841
00:31:49.146 --> 00:31:52.186
You want to work with Park Bo Gum too.

842
00:31:52.186 --> 00:31:53.716
- Yes. - She's cute.

843
00:31:53.716 --> 00:31:55.656
- Park Bo Gum? - I was...

844
00:31:55.656 --> 00:31:58.025
in a program called "Talents for Sale".

845
00:31:58.025 --> 00:31:59.956
Cha Tae Hyun visited.

846
00:32:00.096 --> 00:32:02.696
The cameras were off.

847
00:32:02.696 --> 00:32:05.426
If someone compliments another...

848
00:32:05.426 --> 00:32:07.166
when the cameras are turned off,

849
00:32:07.265 --> 00:32:09.835
- that means the person is nice. - That's right.

850
00:32:09.906 --> 00:32:13.005
He was in "One Night Two Days".

851
00:32:13.005 --> 00:32:16.676
He said, "Bo Gum is a good man. He is so nice and friendly."

852
00:32:17.075 --> 00:32:19.005
"He is a good man."

853
00:32:19.005 --> 00:32:21.916
He told the others that when the cameras were off.

854
00:32:22.075 --> 00:32:23.545
I listened to his words...

855
00:32:23.545 --> 00:32:26.015
and thought, "I see."

856
00:32:26.285 --> 00:32:29.186
He wasn't talking to you, but you eavesdropped.

857
00:32:29.186 --> 00:32:31.585
That's right. It was important.

858
00:32:31.585 --> 00:32:32.785
That's why...

859
00:32:32.785 --> 00:32:33.856
"It was important."

860
00:32:34.356 --> 00:32:37.295
That's why I want to see...

861
00:32:37.366 --> 00:32:39.596
if he is as good as they say.

862
00:32:39.596 --> 00:32:41.166
- You want to meet him. - Yes.

863
00:32:41.166 --> 00:32:42.366
- It can be through acting. - He's nice.

864
00:32:42.366 --> 00:32:45.265
Is there an entertainer you want to work with?

865
00:32:45.265 --> 00:32:47.535
- An entertainer? - It could be one of us.

866
00:32:47.535 --> 00:32:48.706
He is expectant.

867
00:32:48.805 --> 00:32:51.606
It takes time because she has never thought about it.

868
00:32:52.475 --> 00:32:53.515
There is no immediate answer.

869
00:32:53.545 --> 00:32:54.775
She must have someone in mind.

870
00:32:54.775 --> 00:32:56.916
- Anyone? - Woo Do Hwan of variety shows.

871
00:32:57.085 --> 00:32:58.085
- I understand... - I went to the jungle with you.

872
00:32:58.085 --> 00:33:00.156
you don't have many options.

873
00:33:00.186 --> 00:33:02.285
Is there an entertainer who made your heart flutter?

874
00:33:02.285 --> 00:33:04.025
Is there someone who seems to be nice?

875
00:33:04.285 --> 00:33:08.156
To be honest, it will be nice to work with Sae Ho.

876
00:33:08.255 --> 00:33:10.096
He is Woo Do Hwan of variety shows.

877
00:33:10.096 --> 00:33:12.166
He is funny in front of the cameras,

878
00:33:12.166 --> 00:33:14.196
but he is funnier when they are turned off.

879
00:33:14.196 --> 00:33:16.235
- When they are turned off? - That's the biggest problem.

880
00:33:16.466 --> 00:33:18.565
That's the biggest problem.

881
00:33:18.565 --> 00:33:19.735
"When they are turned off."

882
00:33:19.735 --> 00:33:21.876
When the cameras are turned off, I become less nervous.

883
00:33:22.475 --> 00:33:23.475
I really do well.

884
00:33:23.475 --> 00:33:25.575
We should set up a camera in the waiting room.

885
00:33:26.245 --> 00:33:28.346
This is Along with the Queens.

886
00:33:28.346 --> 00:33:29.985
However, I think this is...

887
00:33:29.985 --> 00:33:32.386
more special because of their passion.

888
00:33:32.386 --> 00:33:36.626
Hae Sun is an actress with 22 years of experience.

889
00:33:36.626 --> 00:33:39.156
It hasn't been long since she appeared on TV.

890
00:33:39.156 --> 00:33:42.356
Time passed by quickly because I worked diligently.

891
00:33:42.356 --> 00:33:47.596
I feel like 10 yeas have passed.

892
00:33:47.896 --> 00:33:50.035
- You struggled a lot. - Especially at first, right?

893
00:33:50.035 --> 00:33:51.305
Back in university,

894
00:33:51.436 --> 00:33:55.136
my professor was kind to me.

895
00:33:55.475 --> 00:33:57.745
He made me an understudy of the lead actress.

896
00:33:57.745 --> 00:34:00.575
Back then, people didn't know what an understudy was.

897
00:34:00.575 --> 00:34:01.775
- What is it? - We still don't know.

898
00:34:01.775 --> 00:34:04.315
An understudy is an actress who doesn't take the stage, but...

899
00:34:04.716 --> 00:34:05.785
She practices all the same.

900
00:34:05.785 --> 00:34:08.716
Yes. She becomes a replacement if something happens.

901
00:34:08.716 --> 00:34:10.485
That kind of a chance rarely comes.

902
00:34:10.485 --> 00:34:12.786
It rarely comes.

903
00:34:12.855 --> 00:34:16.696
There was in a scene where the lead actress...

904
00:34:16.696 --> 00:34:18.866
rolls down the stairs.

905
00:34:19.065 --> 00:34:21.735
She ended up ripping hear forehead.

906
00:34:21.735 --> 00:34:25.366
Because she went to the hospital right away,

907
00:34:25.806 --> 00:34:29.645
I finally had a chance to take the stage with much practice.

908
00:34:29.645 --> 00:34:32.815
I put on a costume, a wig, and makeup.

909
00:34:32.815 --> 00:34:34.375
Right before I took the stage...

910
00:34:34.476 --> 00:34:35.915
unexpected thing happened.

911
00:34:36.685 --> 00:34:38.315
- I was asked to come out. - She had returned.

912
00:34:38.315 --> 00:34:41.185
Fortunately, she wasn't badly hurt.

913
00:34:41.185 --> 00:34:43.455
I took off my costume and wig.

914
00:34:43.855 --> 00:34:46.596
I just sat there alone with makeup on.

915
00:34:46.895 --> 00:34:48.726
No one looked after me.

916
00:34:48.726 --> 00:34:50.996
No one cared what I was doing.

917
00:34:51.366 --> 00:34:54.835
There are stairs in Sejong Center Chamber Hall...

918
00:34:54.835 --> 00:34:57.205
that are hidden from the view.

919
00:34:57.266 --> 00:35:01.536
I tried to hold back the tears but ended up bawling.

920
00:35:01.735 --> 00:35:04.275
Like you said, it's fortunate...

921
00:35:04.275 --> 00:35:07.915
- that the injury was minimal. - That's right.

922
00:35:07.915 --> 00:35:09.375
However, someone could have said kind words.

923
00:35:09.375 --> 00:35:13.185
It's understandable because they were busy,

924
00:35:13.185 --> 00:35:16.286
but I couldn't stop the tears.

925
00:35:16.286 --> 00:35:20.926
If the lead actress gets hurt or wants something, I'm on standby.

926
00:35:20.955 --> 00:35:22.996
If she wants water, I get it for her.

927
00:35:23.065 --> 00:35:26.435
If she is sick, I get her medicine. I became that person again.

928
00:35:26.696 --> 00:35:29.906
It's an honor in and of itself,

929
00:35:29.906 --> 00:35:31.835
but I felt sad at the time.

930
00:35:31.835 --> 00:35:35.536
As I cried, I made a wish.

931
00:35:35.536 --> 00:35:36.576
What was the wish?

932
00:35:36.875 --> 00:35:39.875
Someday, I will be an actress...

933
00:35:39.875 --> 00:35:42.746
who takes the stage of Sejong Center Chamber Hall.

934
00:35:43.116 --> 00:35:45.216
That time will come.

935
00:35:45.246 --> 00:35:48.056
I believe that dream...

936
00:35:48.085 --> 00:35:51.625
helped me overcome the struggles.

937
00:35:51.625 --> 00:35:53.955
I practiced harder than anyone.

938
00:35:54.156 --> 00:35:58.565
I became one of the actresses...

939
00:35:58.565 --> 00:36:01.866
who performed the most at Sejong Center Chamber Hall.

940
00:36:02.966 --> 00:36:05.266
(We applaud her for the passion.)

941
00:36:05.266 --> 00:36:06.806
That's incredible.

942
00:36:07.435 --> 00:36:10.446
(Because she overcame the struggles off the stage,)

943
00:36:11.806 --> 00:36:15.875
(Hae Sun shines brighter on the stage.)

944
00:36:16.116 --> 00:36:19.016
Soo Kyung, I apologize in advance...

945
00:36:19.016 --> 00:36:21.255
for asking you this question so suddenly.

946
00:36:21.255 --> 00:36:23.355
They have a good chemistry.

947
00:36:23.485 --> 00:36:26.255
It says here that you struggled because you were never obscure.

948
00:36:27.096 --> 00:36:28.525
Did it have to come right after Hae Sun's question?

949
00:36:28.525 --> 00:36:30.966
That's how the order is.

950
00:36:30.966 --> 00:36:35.165
I prepared to be a celebrity...

951
00:36:35.165 --> 00:36:36.906
after I turned 20.

952
00:36:36.906 --> 00:36:39.466
At first, I auditioned for a commercial.

953
00:36:39.536 --> 00:36:42.005
I got chosen.

954
00:36:42.005 --> 00:36:45.246
I appeared in a lot of commercials.

955
00:36:45.246 --> 00:36:47.375
- You were in a winning streak. - After that,

956
00:36:47.415 --> 00:36:49.846
I auditioned for a drama...

957
00:36:50.386 --> 00:36:52.855
and became the lead actress.

958
00:36:52.855 --> 00:36:55.985
However, I was scared...

959
00:36:55.985 --> 00:36:57.726
because I wasn't ready.

960
00:36:57.985 --> 00:36:59.556
Becoming a lead actress...

961
00:36:59.955 --> 00:37:02.826
made me scared of the camera.

962
00:37:02.826 --> 00:37:03.966
It's understandable.

963
00:37:04.096 --> 00:37:06.435
I couldn't remember the lines.

964
00:37:07.165 --> 00:37:08.866
Because I couldn't deliver the lines,

965
00:37:08.866 --> 00:37:11.806
the shoot kept getting delayed.

966
00:37:11.806 --> 00:37:13.076
- Your colleagues scolded you. - The director...

967
00:37:13.076 --> 00:37:14.505
(She had a heavy heart due to the delay.)

968
00:37:14.505 --> 00:37:16.476
kept scolding me.

969
00:37:16.906 --> 00:37:19.476
Back then, I was really nervous, so in the end...

970
00:37:19.476 --> 00:37:20.716
(In the end...)

971
00:37:20.815 --> 00:37:22.216
There's a tear stick.

972
00:37:22.216 --> 00:37:25.185
- I know. - You use it when you can't cry.

973
00:37:25.485 --> 00:37:28.315
There are times I've used it when it's impossible to cry.

974
00:37:28.315 --> 00:37:30.286
I really wanted to cry, but I just couldn't.

975
00:37:30.286 --> 00:37:31.585
I was nervous.

976
00:37:32.386 --> 00:37:35.056
- Everyone around me was... - They were looking at you.

977
00:37:35.056 --> 00:37:36.266
looking at me.

978
00:37:36.565 --> 00:37:38.926
I wanted to escape from that situation.

979
00:37:39.426 --> 00:37:43.266
So I applied the tear stick all over my eyes,

980
00:37:43.935 --> 00:37:46.065
but I still couldn't cry.

981
00:37:46.576 --> 00:37:48.275
- Really? - You must have been so nervous.

982
00:37:48.275 --> 00:37:49.306
You were too nervous.

983
00:37:49.375 --> 00:37:51.105
I assumed being popular from the start would be a good thing.

984
00:37:51.105 --> 00:37:52.846
I also assumed the same,

985
00:37:52.846 --> 00:37:55.346
- but I didn't know about your this. - I didn't know about your trouble.

986
00:37:55.346 --> 00:37:56.346
- I had no idea. - You weren't ready at all.

987
00:37:56.346 --> 00:38:00.786
When I acted among well-trained actors and actresses,

988
00:38:00.786 --> 00:38:02.685
I infinitely felt so small.

989
00:38:02.685 --> 00:38:04.226
(She'd been scolding herself to improve.)

990
00:38:04.226 --> 00:38:07.096
I really felt so incompetent.

991
00:38:09.525 --> 00:38:12.895
- Now, she's a great actor. - I bet that Se Jeong had...

992
00:38:12.895 --> 00:38:14.395
a hard time during her trainee days.

993
00:38:14.895 --> 00:38:15.966
Right.

994
00:38:16.306 --> 00:38:18.266
I heard your teacher was against your dream of...

995
00:38:18.266 --> 00:38:20.576
- becoming a singer. - I heard you were hurt by that.

996
00:38:20.576 --> 00:38:24.145
When I was young, my family wasn't well-off,

997
00:38:24.145 --> 00:38:26.875
- so I could only go to one academy. - I see.

998
00:38:26.875 --> 00:38:29.016
I had to choose if I was going to attend...

999
00:38:29.016 --> 00:38:31.685
an educational academy or a singing school.

1000
00:38:32.116 --> 00:38:34.485
I decided to attend the singing school.

1001
00:38:34.485 --> 00:38:38.886
I told my teacher that I wouldn't be coming to the academy anymore.

1002
00:38:39.025 --> 00:38:40.926
My teacher asked what my plan was.

1003
00:38:41.556 --> 00:38:46.295
I said that I planned to go to a singing school to become a singer.

1004
00:38:46.295 --> 00:38:47.366
My teacher said,

1005
00:38:47.696 --> 00:38:49.866
"Not everyone can become a singer."

1006
00:38:49.866 --> 00:38:51.536
"You need to study now. You must study."

1007
00:38:51.536 --> 00:38:54.735
"You won't become a singer just because you go to a singing school."

1008
00:38:54.735 --> 00:38:56.505
When people make negative remarks like that,

1009
00:38:57.076 --> 00:38:59.375
- I want to prove them wrong. - You become more determined.

1010
00:38:59.375 --> 00:39:02.346
With determination, I decided that I was going to prove him wrong.

1011
00:39:02.346 --> 00:39:05.286
With that in mind, I practiced hard...

1012
00:39:05.286 --> 00:39:06.915
- and I became a singer. - Yes.

1013
00:39:06.915 --> 00:39:09.455
But after that, what's surprising is that...

1014
00:39:09.726 --> 00:39:12.326
- I filmed "School 2017". - That's right.

1015
00:39:12.685 --> 00:39:14.726
I filmed a scene at an academy.

1016
00:39:14.926 --> 00:39:17.196
But the academy I attended was the set we filmed at.

1017
00:39:17.196 --> 00:39:18.726
- My goodness. - It was the same academy?

1018
00:39:18.726 --> 00:39:19.966
- My gosh. - It was the set. Seriously.

1019
00:39:19.966 --> 00:39:21.596
- You didn't request that? - It was a coincidence.

1020
00:39:21.596 --> 00:39:22.966
- Really? - My goodness.

1021
00:39:22.966 --> 00:39:24.005
- How did they choose that one? - I know, right?

1022
00:39:24.005 --> 00:39:26.306
- That was so weird. - It's a way to prove him wrong.

1023
00:39:26.306 --> 00:39:28.476
- My teacher wasn't there though. - My gosh.

1024
00:39:28.476 --> 00:39:30.976
- Of course he's not there. - Did your teacher run away?

1025
00:39:31.545 --> 00:39:34.516
- How embarrassing. - Oh, no. Se Jeong is coming.

1026
00:39:34.516 --> 00:39:35.915
But I'm sure your teacher knows about your success.

1027
00:39:35.915 --> 00:39:38.446
What I realized afterward is that...

1028
00:39:38.446 --> 00:39:40.185
if I were the teacher...

1029
00:39:40.185 --> 00:39:41.915
and my student said she wanted to become a singer,

1030
00:39:41.915 --> 00:39:43.656
- I would've told her to study too. - "Study".

1031
00:39:43.656 --> 00:39:44.985
- Your teacher motivated you. - I really liked my teacher.

1032
00:39:44.985 --> 00:39:47.226
- Your teacher helped you in a way. - That's true.

1033
00:39:47.226 --> 00:39:49.295
It's quite possible that her teacher might've said that on purpose...

1034
00:39:49.295 --> 00:39:51.565
because he was aware of Se Jeong's disposition.

1035
00:39:51.565 --> 00:39:53.266
- That's a valid point. - Yes, it is.

1036
00:39:53.266 --> 00:39:55.366
Anyway, these four guests joined us today.

1037
00:39:55.366 --> 00:39:57.766
Do you have a future goal you'd like to achieve?

1038
00:39:57.766 --> 00:39:58.966
Can you share yours, Hae Sun?

1039
00:39:58.966 --> 00:40:02.846
As I continue my acting career, I always get these two feelings.

1040
00:40:02.846 --> 00:40:04.906
- I'm scared and excited. - Me too.

1041
00:40:04.906 --> 00:40:07.946
When people asked what kind of role I wanted next in musicals,

1042
00:40:08.346 --> 00:40:10.246
I used to say that I've already played a wide range of roles...

1043
00:40:10.246 --> 00:40:13.016
and that it didn't matter what kind of roles I played,

1044
00:40:13.016 --> 00:40:15.585
but as I started starring in dramas and films, there are so many now.

1045
00:40:15.585 --> 00:40:17.455
- You want to play many roles now. - There are tons of roles I want.

1046
00:40:17.455 --> 00:40:19.955
Now, I have a new goal.

1047
00:40:19.955 --> 00:40:23.696
Whatever role I play, I hope we would cross path in our projects.

1048
00:40:24.466 --> 00:40:25.565
(Let's meet again.)

1049
00:40:25.565 --> 00:40:26.665
Please teach me a lot.

1050
00:40:27.136 --> 00:40:28.935
Soo Kyung, can you share your goal?

1051
00:40:28.935 --> 00:40:31.235
- Tell us your goal. - So far, I played a lot of...

1052
00:40:31.235 --> 00:40:34.176
cheerful and bubbly characters.

1053
00:40:34.176 --> 00:40:36.746
Now, I'd like to try a role of someone like a sociopath.

1054
00:40:37.746 --> 00:40:39.176
- I think you'll be good at it. - It suits you.

1055
00:40:39.176 --> 00:40:40.815
- I think you'll do a great job. - That's great.

1056
00:40:40.815 --> 00:40:44.045
- I want to show different sides... - That's fantastic.

1057
00:40:44.045 --> 00:40:45.485
of me if I get a chance.

1058
00:40:45.886 --> 00:40:46.985
What about you, Sae Ho?

1059
00:40:47.755 --> 00:40:49.016
- I want to stretch often, - Okay.

1060
00:40:49.016 --> 00:40:51.786
so I can be as tall as 168cm in the 1st half of the year.

1061
00:40:52.125 --> 00:40:53.156
Good luck.

1062
00:40:53.355 --> 00:40:55.125
- I will and show you my success. - Seriously.

1063
00:40:56.125 --> 00:40:58.625
I'd like to thank Hae Sun, Soo Kyung,

1064
00:40:58.625 --> 00:41:00.735
Se Jeong, and Bo Reum for joining us today.

1065
00:41:00.735 --> 00:41:03.665
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1066
00:41:04.205 --> 00:41:06.505
- We are Legendary Big Mouth. - Big Mouth.

1067
00:41:06.505 --> 00:41:08.136
(Sing My Song)

1068
00:41:08.136 --> 00:41:10.246
- All right. - Hold on.

1069
00:41:10.246 --> 00:41:12.875
- Soo Yong's outfit is... - I know.

1070
00:41:12.875 --> 00:41:14.216
I thought it was the Grim Reaper's.

1071
00:41:15.415 --> 00:41:18.446
You even put white powder for your makeup today.

1072
00:41:18.446 --> 00:41:20.286
- Let me remind you again. - I wanted to look neat.

1073
00:41:20.286 --> 00:41:22.926
- Soo Yong is only starring on this. - He exclusively stars on our show.

1074
00:41:22.926 --> 00:41:24.556
- I'm exclusive with this show. - He only stars on this.

1075
00:41:24.556 --> 00:41:26.255
- You cannot see me on other shows. - Right.

1076
00:41:26.255 --> 00:41:28.096
Soo Yong didn't plan this to happen.

1077
00:41:28.096 --> 00:41:30.096
- The staff didn't plan it either. - Right.

1078
00:41:30.096 --> 00:41:32.266
He happens to exclusively appear on Happy Together.

1079
00:41:32.366 --> 00:41:33.395
(It's sad, but it's true.)

1080
00:41:33.395 --> 00:41:36.466
- Anyway... - You only appear on this show.

1081
00:41:36.466 --> 00:41:39.065
I didn't know this phase would go this long.

1082
00:41:39.065 --> 00:41:40.076
It's not what I expected.

1083
00:41:40.076 --> 00:41:42.846
- During the break, Yong Man... - Yes?

1084
00:41:42.846 --> 00:41:45.045
became famous as Sean of Ilsan.

1085
00:41:45.045 --> 00:41:46.976
- Sorry? That's new to me. - I know what it's about. I saw it.

1086
00:41:46.976 --> 00:41:49.446
He wrote down habits of his wife...

1087
00:41:49.446 --> 00:41:50.846
- Let me explain this. - and food she likes.

1088
00:41:50.846 --> 00:41:54.685
We were discussing weaknesses like bad sense of direction and number.

1089
00:41:54.685 --> 00:41:56.185
I was asked what my weakness was.

1090
00:41:56.185 --> 00:41:59.386
I told them my weakness is my wife because I don't know her well.

1091
00:41:59.386 --> 00:42:01.926
- So I write notes about her. - That's right.

1092
00:42:01.926 --> 00:42:03.726
They asked me what kind of notes I write.

1093
00:42:03.726 --> 00:42:06.696
I told them I wrote down her sizes and everything else.

1094
00:42:06.696 --> 00:42:08.636
If you're that bad, aren't you suffering from amnesia?

1095
00:42:09.395 --> 00:42:11.565
- You have amnesia then. - Food she likes and dislikes.

1096
00:42:11.565 --> 00:42:14.335
For example, she hates jjajangmyeon,

1097
00:42:14.335 --> 00:42:16.576
- but I'd think she likes that dish. - What is that?

1098
00:42:16.576 --> 00:42:18.145
How could he not know that?

1099
00:42:18.145 --> 00:42:20.116
- How could you know that? - How could you not?

1100
00:42:20.116 --> 00:42:21.616
- I forgot so many times. - You'd feel it.

1101
00:42:21.616 --> 00:42:23.616
- I'd know instinctively. - Is that so?

1102
00:42:23.616 --> 00:42:26.045
You'd know her taste when you share meals with her.

1103
00:42:26.045 --> 00:42:29.786
There was a time my wife and I had ramyeon with Yong Man and his wife.

1104
00:42:29.786 --> 00:42:31.786
- What happened? - I was so surprised that day.

1105
00:42:31.786 --> 00:42:32.786
Why?

1106
00:42:32.786 --> 00:42:34.596
- His wife's name is Nam Jung. - Okay.

1107
00:42:34.596 --> 00:42:36.726
He said, "Nam Jung can't eat hard noodles."

1108
00:42:37.226 --> 00:42:39.665
"She eats completely cooked noodles." He told me that.

1109
00:42:39.665 --> 00:42:42.065
- I thought that he was... - She scolded so many times before.

1110
00:42:42.536 --> 00:42:44.536
"How many times must I tell you?"

1111
00:42:44.735 --> 00:42:46.105
- So I was... - My goodness.

1112
00:42:46.105 --> 00:42:49.775
- When he was single, - Right.

1113
00:42:49.775 --> 00:42:52.076
he used to write a lot of notes.

1114
00:42:52.946 --> 00:42:55.815
- Jae Seok, change your outfit. - Jae Seok.

1115
00:42:55.815 --> 00:42:57.946
- That's true. - You should wear a red outfit.

1116
00:42:57.946 --> 00:43:01.485
- He brought up... I remember that. - What was your favorite bar?

1117
00:43:01.485 --> 00:43:02.516
Jae Seok.

1118
00:43:02.516 --> 00:43:04.485
- I didn't know you'd bring that up. - I was just playing.

1119
00:43:04.485 --> 00:43:05.826
Let me explain you the details.

1120
00:43:05.826 --> 00:43:07.755
- Stop it. - You seem very happy about it.

1121
00:43:07.755 --> 00:43:09.596
- Let's call it quits now. - Hey, two of you...

1122
00:43:09.596 --> 00:43:12.326
- Do you all want to go down? - It's not that.

1123
00:43:12.326 --> 00:43:13.366
- No. - This is crazy.

1124
00:43:13.366 --> 00:43:15.766
- Listen. - I'll start with your first love.

1125
00:43:15.766 --> 00:43:16.906
- Then should I spill the beans too? - Go ahead.

1126
00:43:16.906 --> 00:43:17.966
You will?

1127
00:43:17.966 --> 00:43:19.775
- Everyone will be done then. - Today's show will be a good one.

1128
00:43:19.775 --> 00:43:21.205
A long time ago, In Yi...

1129
00:43:21.205 --> 00:43:22.735
- You! - In Yi.

1130
00:43:22.735 --> 00:43:24.605
- A scandalous special. - How could you say her real name?

1131
00:43:24.605 --> 00:43:26.346
(A scandalous special)

1132
00:43:26.346 --> 00:43:27.676
- In Yi... - We'll all go down.

1133
00:43:27.676 --> 00:43:29.315
- I can't believe you. - It was In Yi.

1134
00:43:29.315 --> 00:43:31.315
- That one was a big one. - This is unbelievable.

1135
00:43:31.315 --> 00:43:33.955
- Let's stop it now. - Yes, let's stop.

1136
00:43:34.056 --> 00:43:36.625
- We were just goofing around. - Right. We were joking.

1137
00:43:36.625 --> 00:43:37.786
Let's not dig up our past.

1138
00:43:37.786 --> 00:43:39.926
- If I spill, he's done for. - Everyone will be destroyed.

1139
00:43:39.926 --> 00:43:41.455
- He will be buried alive. - Right.

1140
00:43:41.826 --> 00:43:44.926
The lesson is writing notes is a good habit.

1141
00:43:44.926 --> 00:43:46.795
- Precisely. - Let's leave it at that.

1142
00:43:46.795 --> 00:43:48.966
- Of course. - It's because you'd get confused...

1143
00:43:48.966 --> 00:43:50.766
- about who is who. - Stop it.

1144
00:43:50.766 --> 00:43:52.105
- He'd get confused... - That's enough.

1145
00:43:52.105 --> 00:43:54.605
Anyway, I heard shocking news not so long ago.

1146
00:43:54.605 --> 00:43:56.246
- That was so sudden. - You're changing the subject.

1147
00:43:56.246 --> 00:43:57.346
- A change of topic. - What was that?

1148
00:43:57.346 --> 00:43:59.476
(A sudden development)

1149
00:43:59.476 --> 00:44:04.545
There are five legendary figures nobody can dish on in Korea.

1150
00:44:04.545 --> 00:44:06.286
- One of us belongs to the list. - Is that so?

1151
00:44:06.286 --> 00:44:08.255
- The first one is Lee Guk Jong. - I agree.

1152
00:44:08.255 --> 00:44:10.185
- Kim Yun A, Park Ji Sung, - Okay.

1153
00:44:10.185 --> 00:44:12.085
- and Chairman of Ottogi. - The chairman?

1154
00:44:12.085 --> 00:44:13.125
- Right. - The chairman.

1155
00:44:13.295 --> 00:44:15.625
- And Jae Seok is one of them. - Is it Jae Seok?

1156
00:44:15.625 --> 00:44:16.826
I am?

1157
00:44:17.165 --> 00:44:18.795
- I was so surprised. - We can't tease him.

1158
00:44:18.795 --> 00:44:21.136
- So we've been teasing him? - Don't say that.

1159
00:44:21.136 --> 00:44:22.596
I want to mess with him,

1160
00:44:22.596 --> 00:44:24.705
but I can't do that without feeling scared.

1161
00:44:25.505 --> 00:44:29.705
- Putting everything aside, - I really want to tease him.

1162
00:44:29.705 --> 00:44:31.605
you can't tease me after I mentioned your habit of writing notes.

1163
00:44:31.875 --> 00:44:32.946
That's one of the reasons too.

1164
00:44:33.315 --> 00:44:35.176
- You changed all of a sudden. - Know this before you tease him.

1165
00:44:35.176 --> 00:44:36.985
- Let's tease him. - I'm warning especially you.

1166
00:44:36.985 --> 00:44:39.085
- What do you mean? - You'd better be careful.

1167
00:44:39.085 --> 00:44:41.185
- A long time ago, - Do you...

1168
00:44:41.185 --> 00:44:42.716
- want me to poke the beehive? - A long time ago...

1169
00:44:43.886 --> 00:44:44.955
I mean...

1170
00:44:44.955 --> 00:44:47.455
- By the way, last week, - Okay.

1171
00:44:47.455 --> 00:44:49.895
we had a record that shocked a lot of viewers.

1172
00:44:50.665 --> 00:44:53.766
Every singer got off work without using any of the chances.

1173
00:44:53.766 --> 00:44:54.766
That's right.

1174
00:44:54.766 --> 00:44:56.866
- Wanna One is truly famous. - I agree.

1175
00:44:57.406 --> 00:45:00.275
- They went off work first. - My gosh.

1176
00:45:00.275 --> 00:45:01.576
What about the late-night snacks?

1177
00:45:01.576 --> 00:45:04.045
I heard that they thoroughly enjoyed the snacks in the car.

1178
00:45:04.045 --> 00:45:05.105
Right.

1179
00:45:05.205 --> 00:45:07.846
They sent us a thank-you message.

1180
00:45:07.846 --> 00:45:09.076
- They sent it to you? - To you, Yong Man?

1181
00:45:09.076 --> 00:45:10.085
No, to the staff.

1182
00:45:11.085 --> 00:45:13.585
Anyway, we have another special.

1183
00:45:13.585 --> 00:45:15.485
We will be joined by some amazing singers.

1184
00:45:15.485 --> 00:45:17.326
It's Last Singer Special.

1185
00:45:19.326 --> 00:45:21.255
(For past months, the best singers...)

1186
00:45:21.895 --> 00:45:23.496
(have been raiding the karaoke.)

1187
00:45:24.496 --> 00:45:27.636
(Some singers enjoyed their time and got off work.)

1188
00:45:29.196 --> 00:45:33.306
(But some singers were only hurt and couldn't get off work.)

1189
00:45:34.105 --> 00:45:35.536
(Would you like to try again?)

1190
00:45:35.536 --> 00:45:37.676
(Would you do it if you were me?)

1191
00:45:39.275 --> 00:45:41.045
(So we prepared this special.)

1192
00:45:41.915 --> 00:45:44.746
(Last singers whom we loved, the Best of the Best)

1193
00:45:45.045 --> 00:45:47.056
- Singers from previous episodes? - Yes.

1194
00:45:47.056 --> 00:45:49.955
- Right, but they were humiliated. - To redeem themselves?

1195
00:45:50.326 --> 00:45:51.355
They will be on our show today.

1196
00:45:51.355 --> 00:45:52.726
- Today's episode will be fun. - Exactly.

1197
00:45:52.726 --> 00:45:56.266
The ultimate, last singer will be determined today then.

1198
00:45:56.625 --> 00:45:58.665
Last singer among last singers.

1199
00:45:58.665 --> 00:46:01.335
All right. So for today's special, the whole team...

1200
00:46:01.335 --> 00:46:03.866
- will face the same consequence. - Okay.

1201
00:46:04.165 --> 00:46:06.735
The same host from previous shows will share the same fate.

1202
00:46:06.735 --> 00:46:09.406
- I'll team up with the same singer. - That's right.

1203
00:46:09.406 --> 00:46:11.176
- So this is our second try. - Exactly.

1204
00:46:11.676 --> 00:46:14.545
Let's find out which singer will sing...

1205
00:46:14.545 --> 00:46:19.446
at the end which is the worst and ultimately the last singer.

1206
00:46:19.446 --> 00:46:21.855
Let me present you the first singer. Please come on out.

1207
00:46:22.255 --> 00:46:24.085
- We'll figure out right away. - We'll know our partners.

1208
00:46:24.085 --> 00:46:25.926
- I know who that is. - That's Kim Kyung Ho.

1209
00:46:25.926 --> 00:46:27.426
- That's Kim Kyung Ho. - It's Kyung Ho.

1210
00:46:27.426 --> 00:46:29.895
- He looks so lonely there. - He flips his hair first.

1211
00:46:30.596 --> 00:46:32.366
(Do you like the song, "Like It" that much?)

1212
00:46:33.136 --> 00:46:35.165
- He's singing "Like It". - It's "Like It".

1213
00:46:35.165 --> 00:46:36.565
He's trying to beat Yoon Jong Shin.

1214
00:46:37.205 --> 00:46:38.266
It's "Like It".

1215
00:46:38.266 --> 00:46:41.235
(It's been really hard)

1216
00:46:41.235 --> 00:46:45.275
(I'm talking about how the show ended.)

1217
00:46:46.446 --> 00:46:48.976
- He's good. - He's a great singer.

1218
00:46:49.985 --> 00:46:52.446
(Do you like it?)

1219
00:46:52.446 --> 00:46:54.156
(No!)

1220
00:46:54.915 --> 00:46:58.556
(He's the very 1st singer who failed to get off work.)

1221
00:46:59.996 --> 00:47:03.696
(His sorrow exudes from his back.)

1222
00:47:04.125 --> 00:47:05.326
But the song suits him nicely.

1223
00:47:05.625 --> 00:47:08.565
- If he is last again today... - Who was...

1224
00:47:08.565 --> 00:47:10.335
- Were you his partner, Soo Hong? - Yes.

1225
00:47:11.536 --> 00:47:13.576
(Would you endure it?)

1226
00:47:14.636 --> 00:47:18.605
(Would you endure the emptiness and loneliness?)

1227
00:47:19.846 --> 00:47:21.716
(To recover his pride,)

1228
00:47:21.716 --> 00:47:22.915
- He sings well. - He's really good.

1229
00:47:23.145 --> 00:47:26.255
(Kyung Ho has come back.)

1230
00:47:27.915 --> 00:47:32.455
(All he did last time was showing off how charming he is.)

1231
00:47:34.656 --> 00:47:37.326
(But he still can't forget about what happened.)

1232
00:47:37.326 --> 00:47:38.326
I love the song.

1233
00:47:38.326 --> 00:47:40.496
(Not being able to forget what happened,)

1234
00:47:40.665 --> 00:47:43.536
(he desperately waited for this day.)

1235
00:47:44.266 --> 00:47:46.036
(We understand your feeling.)

1236
00:47:48.875 --> 00:47:49.946
It's Kyung Ho.

1237
00:47:49.946 --> 00:47:51.176
(National Rocker Kim Kyung Ho revisits Happy Together.)

1238
00:47:51.275 --> 00:47:52.346
Even if he doesn't turn back, we know that it's him.

1239
00:47:53.145 --> 00:47:55.915
(It's a classy way to vent out your sorrow.)

1240
00:47:55.915 --> 00:47:57.585
This is it, isn't it? Isn't this the highest part?

1241
00:47:57.886 --> 00:48:00.585
Just one-tenth of the pain I am feeling

1242
00:48:00.585 --> 00:48:02.386
(This is the highlight of "Like It".)

1243
00:48:02.386 --> 00:48:03.426
"I'm in pain".

1244
00:48:04.185 --> 00:48:05.185
(I'm in pain)

1245
00:48:05.185 --> 00:48:07.156
He hits high notes effortlessly.

1246
00:48:07.295 --> 00:48:08.525
This is the tough part.

1247
00:48:09.766 --> 00:48:13.696
(He's without a doubt Kyung Ho.)

1248
00:48:14.735 --> 00:48:18.005
He sang the last part of "Like It"...

1249
00:48:18.005 --> 00:48:19.806
like the singer Park Dong Jin.

1250
00:48:19.806 --> 00:48:22.176
"I'm in pain".

1251
00:48:22.176 --> 00:48:23.446
(He sounded like Park Dong Jin.)

1252
00:48:23.446 --> 00:48:24.775
You have to make your uvula tremble.

1253
00:48:24.775 --> 00:48:26.976
I'm in pain

1254
00:48:26.976 --> 00:48:28.176
- I'm in pain - He's like Jo Tong Dal.

1255
00:48:28.275 --> 00:48:31.386
I think this will become a popular meme.

1256
00:48:31.386 --> 00:48:34.056
We had a nice start with "Like It".

1257
00:48:34.056 --> 00:48:36.386
He's an important part...

1258
00:48:36.386 --> 00:48:38.056
- of Sing My Song. - He is.

1259
00:48:38.056 --> 00:48:40.326
- I think he will go last again. - Do you think so?

1260
00:48:40.326 --> 00:48:41.426
- That's what I think. - He's going last?

1261
00:48:41.426 --> 00:48:42.795
- I have a feeling. - Why would you say that?

1262
00:48:42.795 --> 00:48:44.996
I am free to express my feelings.

1263
00:48:45.496 --> 00:48:46.636
(Park Soo Hong and Kim Kyung Ho)

1264
00:48:46.636 --> 00:48:47.696
Welcome!

1265
00:48:48.335 --> 00:48:50.335
Go, Kyung Ho!

1266
00:48:50.335 --> 00:48:52.136
Kyung Ho is back.

1267
00:48:52.136 --> 00:48:54.306
Kim Kyung Ho!

1268
00:48:54.636 --> 00:48:56.076
Kim Kyung Ho!

1269
00:48:56.375 --> 00:48:57.775
- Welcome. - He looks beautiful from the back.

1270
00:48:57.775 --> 00:48:59.145
- He looks beautiful. - Do you like "Like It" that much?

1271
00:48:59.145 --> 00:49:00.516
- My goodness. - You chose...

1272
00:49:00.516 --> 00:49:02.176
- My gosh. - This way.

1273
00:49:02.176 --> 00:49:04.085
I intentionally vented my anger.

1274
00:49:04.415 --> 00:49:05.946
Do you like "Like It" so much?

1275
00:49:05.946 --> 00:49:06.985
(Is he trying to make the phrase become popular?)

1276
00:49:06.985 --> 00:49:09.685
It seems like you have finally managed...

1277
00:49:09.685 --> 00:49:11.556
- to get out of the shock. - Yes.

1278
00:49:11.556 --> 00:49:12.656
But you're here again.

1279
00:49:12.656 --> 00:49:15.096
When I was becoming fine again, you got me here.

1280
00:49:15.096 --> 00:49:16.726
Thank you for keeping your promise.

1281
00:49:17.266 --> 00:49:18.826
You will be able to recover your honor.

1282
00:49:18.826 --> 00:49:20.235
- He will take his revenge. - He will.

1283
00:49:20.235 --> 00:49:23.835
Do you still bear grudges against "Like It"?

1284
00:49:23.835 --> 00:49:28.375
I didn't know that this song was such a hit.

1285
00:49:28.375 --> 00:49:30.346
But this song was played wherever I went.

1286
00:49:30.346 --> 00:49:32.306
This song is very popular in karaokes.

1287
00:49:32.306 --> 00:49:34.415
I can tell that it's very popular.

1288
00:49:34.415 --> 00:49:37.085
Just a while ago, someone else was singing this song.

1289
00:49:37.085 --> 00:49:38.116
(We expected it.)

1290
00:49:38.116 --> 00:49:39.516
- There's a female version too. - By the way,

1291
00:49:39.516 --> 00:49:40.656
- It's a nice song. - it's not even my song,

1292
00:49:40.656 --> 00:49:42.516
and yet I giggle whenever I hear "Like It".

1293
00:49:42.755 --> 00:49:43.755
(That's how much impact "Like It" has on Kyung Ho.)

1294
00:49:43.755 --> 00:49:44.826
Why is that happening?

1295
00:49:46.125 --> 00:49:49.696
(Someone else sings it in another room.)

1296
00:49:50.625 --> 00:49:52.226
He's singing "Like It" again.

1297
00:49:54.696 --> 00:49:56.505
(Please be happy)

1298
00:49:56.505 --> 00:49:59.406
Why does he keep begging to be happy?

1299
00:49:59.705 --> 00:50:00.935
(He's suffering from the severe aftereffects.)

1300
00:50:00.935 --> 00:50:02.036
Why do people love it so much?

1301
00:50:02.636 --> 00:50:03.806
Do you like "Like It" that much?

1302
00:50:03.806 --> 00:50:05.205
I was busy getting my hair done,

1303
00:50:05.205 --> 00:50:07.275
and my hairdresser said, "Gosh, it's 'Like It' again."

1304
00:50:07.616 --> 00:50:09.016
(He's surrounded by "Like It".)

1305
00:50:09.145 --> 00:50:11.616
Before this, you were annoyed by Kwon Hyeok Soo.

1306
00:50:11.616 --> 00:50:14.286
- Now it's "Like It". - I am a total wreck.

1307
00:50:14.286 --> 00:50:16.685
I was surprised to hear his version of "Like It".

1308
00:50:17.156 --> 00:50:19.455
- The last part was amazing. - I envy him.

1309
00:50:19.826 --> 00:50:21.596
- I'm in pain - I'm in pain

1310
00:50:21.656 --> 00:50:23.525
When did I do that?

1311
00:50:23.525 --> 00:50:25.426
- You can watch the show. - Watch it.

1312
00:50:25.426 --> 00:50:28.096
- Show him. - He didn't sound like Hyeok Soo.

1313
00:50:28.096 --> 00:50:30.036
- He sounded like... - A master singer.

1314
00:50:30.235 --> 00:50:32.065
- Yes. Mr. Jo Tong Dal. - Mr. Jo Tong Dal.

1315
00:50:32.065 --> 00:50:34.406
- I'm in pain - Ever since I was on this show...

1316
00:50:34.406 --> 00:50:36.476
- Please sing it here. - I never sing like Hyeok Soo.

1317
00:50:36.476 --> 00:50:40.446
But ever since I was on this show, people started giggling when I sing.

1318
00:50:40.446 --> 00:50:41.645
Honestly...

1319
00:50:42.176 --> 00:50:43.616
Please be happy

1320
00:50:43.616 --> 00:50:44.685
This is how I usually sing.

1321
00:50:44.685 --> 00:50:46.915
Please be happy

1322
00:50:46.915 --> 00:50:48.085
But I feel like I should be singing like this.

1323
00:50:48.116 --> 00:50:49.415
Everyone expects me to sing like that.

1324
00:50:49.415 --> 00:50:50.525
But you clearly sang "I'm in pain" like that.

1325
00:50:50.525 --> 00:50:52.525
- That's how you sang it. - I'm in pain

1326
00:50:52.525 --> 00:50:54.696
- You did. - Try it.

1327
00:50:54.696 --> 00:50:57.165
I'm in pain

1328
00:50:57.326 --> 00:50:58.426
(That's it.)

1329
00:50:58.895 --> 00:51:01.735
(I'm in pain)

1330
00:51:04.306 --> 00:51:05.435
- See? - That's it.

1331
00:51:05.435 --> 00:51:07.335
- Are you... - I'm in pain

1332
00:51:07.676 --> 00:51:10.906
It's like someone was hitting your throat.

1333
00:51:10.906 --> 00:51:12.505
- You did that. - You can't do this to me.

1334
00:51:12.505 --> 00:51:14.246
I'm just joking.

1335
00:51:14.246 --> 00:51:17.846
Soo Hong and Kyung Ho...

1336
00:51:17.846 --> 00:51:20.355
will be the first team of this special.

1337
00:51:20.355 --> 00:51:22.016
- You make a good team. - I need to go home early.

1338
00:51:23.326 --> 00:51:25.085
Let's bring in the second singer.

1339
00:51:25.085 --> 00:51:27.156
- I think I know who it is. -Do you?

1340
00:51:27.156 --> 00:51:28.996
It's one of the people who have experienced it.

1341
00:51:28.996 --> 00:51:32.096
- This person is... - Is it Gummy?

1342
00:51:32.096 --> 00:51:34.466
going to vent out his sorrow through dancing.

1343
00:51:34.466 --> 00:51:36.065
It's g.o.d. then.

1344
00:51:36.806 --> 00:51:38.335
- What's this song? - It's "Lie".

1345
00:51:38.335 --> 00:51:39.806
- It's g.o.d's "Lie". - It's g.o.d's "Lie".

1346
00:51:39.806 --> 00:51:40.976
- It's Tae Woo. - It's easy.

1347
00:51:41.835 --> 00:51:45.676
(He reacted to "Lie" immediately.)

1348
00:51:45.676 --> 00:51:47.076
It's g.o.d's "Lie".

1349
00:51:47.616 --> 00:51:49.246
(I am sorry.)

1350
00:51:49.246 --> 00:51:51.886
(I am sorry, but I love you, they're all lies)

1351
00:51:52.145 --> 00:51:54.286
(It was Big Bang's "Lie".)

1352
00:51:54.685 --> 00:51:56.156
(It was like a lie to him.)

1353
00:51:57.585 --> 00:52:00.226
(He's the first ending singer, Kim Tae Woo.)

1354
00:52:01.196 --> 00:52:03.696
(He vents out his anger at a karaoke.)

1355
00:52:05.165 --> 00:52:06.235
- I was right. - It's Tae Woo.

1356
00:52:06.235 --> 00:52:07.466
He's my partner.

1357
00:52:07.496 --> 00:52:10.366
- It's him. - It won't be easy today.

1358
00:52:11.005 --> 00:52:12.976
(Jee Seok Jin and Kim Tae Woo)

1359
00:52:14.036 --> 00:52:16.906
It's Tae Woo.

1360
00:52:16.906 --> 00:52:18.375
He must have a lot to say.

1361
00:52:18.576 --> 00:52:21.645
He was here...

1362
00:52:21.645 --> 00:52:23.746
- on the first episode. - He was.

1363
00:52:24.116 --> 00:52:25.645
He must have a lot to say.

1364
00:52:26.556 --> 00:52:29.926
I became very humble ever since I was here.

1365
00:52:30.485 --> 00:52:31.525
Right.

1366
00:52:32.125 --> 00:52:33.455
He's right.

1367
00:52:33.955 --> 00:52:35.996
- After I was here, - How has it been?

1368
00:52:35.996 --> 00:52:39.395
I listened to all of my previous songs.

1369
00:52:39.395 --> 00:52:40.466
(It became an opportunity to look back on his career.)

1370
00:52:40.466 --> 00:52:41.536
It was...

1371
00:52:43.835 --> 00:52:45.036
I have a lot of hits.

1372
00:52:45.036 --> 00:52:46.375
- You do. - You have a lot.

1373
00:52:46.375 --> 00:52:48.406
- He's got a lot of hits. - Everyone loves g.o.d.'s songs.

1374
00:52:48.406 --> 00:52:51.105
"Love Rain" was his song, but it was a huge hit.

1375
00:52:51.105 --> 00:52:53.616
I think it was the area that failed me.

1376
00:52:54.076 --> 00:52:55.676
- Right. - It was the area.

1377
00:52:56.145 --> 00:52:58.485
- It was around Hongdae. - It was.

1378
00:52:58.485 --> 00:53:00.415
You were in Hongdae, but I was in a women's university area.

1379
00:53:01.185 --> 00:53:04.355
But you fit into the area perfectly.

1380
00:53:04.855 --> 00:53:06.156
You clearly fit in.

1381
00:53:06.156 --> 00:53:09.226
It was done on purpose.

1382
00:53:09.226 --> 00:53:10.996
What was done on purpose?

1383
00:53:10.996 --> 00:53:12.895
They were determined to crush me.

1384
00:53:12.895 --> 00:53:14.466
You think it was their big picture.

1385
00:53:15.065 --> 00:53:16.766
Are you confident today, Kyung Ho?

1386
00:53:16.766 --> 00:53:19.335
As you said earlier,

1387
00:53:19.335 --> 00:53:21.806
this is a chance for me and Tae Woo...

1388
00:53:21.806 --> 00:53:26.045
to recover our honor. It's like a consolation match.

1389
00:53:26.045 --> 00:53:28.016
- Right. - I even got to...

1390
00:53:28.246 --> 00:53:30.886
choose one among Yeoksam-dong, Gwanghwamun, and Yeouido.

1391
00:53:30.886 --> 00:53:32.246
- You did. - I chose...

1392
00:53:32.246 --> 00:53:34.485
Yeoksam-dong, because I would have the most advantage.

1393
00:53:34.485 --> 00:53:36.426
- We're in Yeoksam-dong now. - We are in Yeoksam-dong.

1394
00:53:36.426 --> 00:53:39.426
- But today... - I was going to say this later.

1395
00:53:39.426 --> 00:53:42.025
- But we are in Yeoksam-dong today. - We're in Yeoksam-dong.

1396
00:53:42.025 --> 00:53:45.266
On the way here, I realized that this area has changed a lot.

1397
00:53:45.266 --> 00:53:46.295
Why do you say that?

1398
00:53:46.636 --> 00:53:48.065
It's true.

1399
00:53:48.065 --> 00:53:49.806
It's filled with youngsters now.

1400
00:53:49.806 --> 00:53:51.235
I was surprised too.

1401
00:53:51.235 --> 00:53:53.005
It's more like Hongdae now.

1402
00:53:53.005 --> 00:53:55.306
(This is not the Yeoksam-dong I imagined.)

1403
00:53:56.576 --> 00:53:59.446
I thought it was strange too,

1404
00:53:59.446 --> 00:54:01.016
so I asked my manager.

1405
00:54:01.016 --> 00:54:03.685
My manager is in his early 30s,

1406
00:54:03.685 --> 00:54:06.185
- and this is where they hang out. - Right.

1407
00:54:06.185 --> 00:54:08.255
I asked him, and he said something fortunate.

1408
00:54:08.255 --> 00:54:09.786
The area across the street,

1409
00:54:10.226 --> 00:54:13.795
where the cinema is, is crowded by young people.

1410
00:54:13.895 --> 00:54:16.096
- That area is young. - But this area is fine.

1411
00:54:16.096 --> 00:54:17.125
- I know. - Right.

1412
00:54:17.125 --> 00:54:19.266
That's how desperate I was!

1413
00:54:19.866 --> 00:54:21.496
- He had to analyze the area. - He was desperate.

1414
00:54:21.496 --> 00:54:22.866
- I feel better. - They have...

1415
00:54:22.866 --> 00:54:24.705
finished analyzing the area.

1416
00:54:24.705 --> 00:54:26.275
- Yes. - And...

1417
00:54:26.275 --> 00:54:28.906
I arrived here about 30 to 40 minutes earlier.

1418
00:54:28.906 --> 00:54:31.605
The songs they sing are...

1419
00:54:31.705 --> 00:54:32.705
- How are they? - They're quite old, aren't they?

1420
00:54:32.705 --> 00:54:34.846
They sang K2's songs.

1421
00:54:37.185 --> 00:54:38.415
"I Can't Have You".

1422
00:54:38.415 --> 00:54:39.485
(K2? Bank?)

1423
00:54:39.485 --> 00:54:41.016
- You have the advantage. - Did they sing Bank's song?

1424
00:54:41.016 --> 00:54:42.116
- You're good now. - See?

1425
00:54:43.226 --> 00:54:45.726
("I Can't Have You" by Bank)

1426
00:54:46.525 --> 00:54:49.125
I think Kyung Ho has the most advantage.

1427
00:54:49.766 --> 00:54:50.866
Yes!

1428
00:54:50.895 --> 00:54:51.926
Right now...

1429
00:54:52.366 --> 00:54:54.496
- All right. - He's excited.

1430
00:54:54.496 --> 00:54:56.536
That's very good news.

1431
00:54:56.866 --> 00:55:00.275
Those are the songs...

1432
00:55:00.275 --> 00:55:02.036
people rarely sing.

1433
00:55:02.036 --> 00:55:03.576
Someone sang K2's song.

1434
00:55:03.576 --> 00:55:05.746
- It's very rare to see that. - It's perfect.

1435
00:55:05.746 --> 00:55:06.746
It's hard to sing too.

1436
00:55:06.746 --> 00:55:10.145
Yeoksam is a place...

1437
00:55:10.145 --> 00:55:12.516
full of hope.

1438
00:55:12.516 --> 00:55:15.286
We hope it will make our singers happy.

1439
00:55:15.286 --> 00:55:17.355
Let's give it up for Yeoksam.

1440
00:55:17.355 --> 00:55:18.426
(Yeoksam is the land of promises and opportunities.)

1441
00:55:18.726 --> 00:55:21.025
- Yeoksam. - Yeoksam.

1442
00:55:21.025 --> 00:55:23.426
Let's bring in the third singer.

1443
00:55:23.466 --> 00:55:25.065
Who would it be?

1444
00:55:25.065 --> 00:55:28.295
- It's Yong Man's partner. - It must be Fly to the Sky.

1445
00:55:30.105 --> 00:55:32.235
("10 Reasons to Love You" by Lee Seok Hoon)

1446
00:55:33.906 --> 00:55:35.505
- Are we all failed ones? - Is it Gummy?

1447
00:55:35.505 --> 00:55:36.846
It's a man.

1448
00:55:37.076 --> 00:55:38.476
- Is it Seok Hoon? - It looks like Seok Hoon.

1449
00:55:38.476 --> 00:55:40.045
His hair looks like Seok Hoon's.

1450
00:55:40.045 --> 00:55:41.915
- It's Seok Hoon. - Is it Seok Hoon?

1451
00:55:41.915 --> 00:55:43.216
- Seok Hoon. - It's Seok Hoon.

1452
00:55:43.216 --> 00:55:44.846
- What's that song? - It's Seok Hoon.

1453
00:55:44.846 --> 00:55:47.016
That's how he dances even to a dance song.

1454
00:55:47.016 --> 00:55:48.185
It's Seok Hoon.

1455
00:55:49.116 --> 00:55:52.556
I am sick and tired of him.

1456
00:55:54.726 --> 00:55:56.395
(Ta-da!)

1457
00:55:57.226 --> 00:55:58.826
(Hello, Yong Man.)

1458
00:56:02.136 --> 00:56:04.005
(He was determined not to sing SG Wannabe's songs he didn't sing.)

1459
00:56:04.536 --> 00:56:06.036
(Seok Hoon and Yong Man shouldn't have been a team.)

1460
00:56:06.406 --> 00:56:08.005
(And...)

1461
00:56:08.005 --> 00:56:09.906
(Seok Hoon got unlucky once again.)

1462
00:56:10.306 --> 00:56:11.375
(Who is he?)

1463
00:56:12.846 --> 00:56:14.716
(They didn't recognize him.)

1464
00:56:16.045 --> 00:56:18.045
(It was the most awkward scene...)

1465
00:56:18.045 --> 00:56:19.556
(in the history of Sing My Song.)

1466
00:56:19.985 --> 00:56:22.056
(He was the third person to go home, but it was as if he was last.)

1467
00:56:23.426 --> 00:56:27.656
(Today, he's venting out his sorrow while singing alone.)

1468
00:56:28.426 --> 00:56:30.295
(It sounds sweet.)

1469
00:56:32.025 --> 00:56:33.196
- I... - I didn't recognize him.

1470
00:56:33.196 --> 00:56:35.036
He's singing the same song.

1471
00:56:35.036 --> 00:56:36.165
He's singing it now.

1472
00:56:36.165 --> 00:56:37.705
And it's so much better to watch him.

1473
00:56:38.466 --> 00:56:40.806
It felt so uncomfortable last time.

1474
00:56:41.275 --> 00:56:43.476
That's when we figured this out.

1475
00:56:43.676 --> 00:56:46.415
Not everyone who sings your song is your fan.

1476
00:56:46.415 --> 00:56:48.846
- It's very fascinating. - They just love your song.

1477
00:56:48.846 --> 00:56:51.485
He's different from you two.

1478
00:56:51.485 --> 00:56:53.915
He succeeded to go home. He was the third.

1479
00:56:54.085 --> 00:56:55.685
- Despite the success... - Did he succeed?

1480
00:56:55.685 --> 00:56:56.755
- He did. - He was the third to go.

1481
00:56:56.755 --> 00:56:57.985
- Was he the 3rd? - Was he the 3rd?

1482
00:56:57.985 --> 00:56:59.496
Then why do I keep thinking that he had failed?

1483
00:56:59.496 --> 00:57:02.295
He was the 3rd person to succeed, but it was as if he was the 4th.

1484
00:57:02.295 --> 00:57:03.565
He was just like the fourth.

1485
00:57:03.565 --> 00:57:05.926
- That's humiliating. - Yong Man knows his name now,

1486
00:57:05.926 --> 00:57:07.665
but at the time, he called him "Kim Seok Hoon".

1487
00:57:09.605 --> 00:57:11.966
We shouldn't be partners again.

1488
00:57:12.205 --> 00:57:14.105
(Kim Yong Man and Lee Seok Hoon)

1489
00:57:14.275 --> 00:57:15.275
Welcome.

1490
00:57:15.275 --> 00:57:16.846
(He's the 3rd person to enter.)

1491
00:57:16.846 --> 00:57:18.946
- He still... - Welcome.

1492
00:57:18.946 --> 00:57:20.645
- He's still the same. - He hasn't changed.

1493
00:57:20.645 --> 00:57:22.476
He looks like he's coming from a church.

1494
00:57:22.846 --> 00:57:24.216
He's the only singer here who hadn't failed.

1495
00:57:24.216 --> 00:57:25.446
It's as if he was the last.

1496
00:57:25.446 --> 00:57:27.755
He was actually third to go home, but it was as if he was the last.

1497
00:57:27.755 --> 00:57:28.855
- It was. - Right.

1498
00:57:28.855 --> 00:57:31.056
It's better to just be the last one.

1499
00:57:31.255 --> 00:57:32.255
(How dare you come here?)

1500
00:57:32.255 --> 00:57:33.255
Have a seat.

1501
00:57:33.826 --> 00:57:35.556
I heard people didn't recognize you.

1502
00:57:35.826 --> 00:57:37.096
That's right.

1503
00:57:37.096 --> 00:57:38.895
You didn't tell me that.

1504
00:57:38.895 --> 00:57:41.466
- Did he not tell you? - We already said everything.

1505
00:57:41.466 --> 00:57:43.466
- Did he only say that he succeeded? - He said he didn't fail.

1506
00:57:43.466 --> 00:57:44.565
Right.

1507
00:57:44.636 --> 00:57:46.306
But he couldn't tell you.

1508
00:57:46.435 --> 00:57:49.946
Seok Hoon is here once again.

1509
00:57:49.946 --> 00:57:53.545
It's nice to have you here. Seok Hoon,

1510
00:57:53.946 --> 00:57:57.746
you barely managed to succeed. But it's hard to say that you succeeded.

1511
00:57:57.746 --> 00:58:00.116
- We remember it as a failure. - No.

1512
00:58:00.116 --> 00:58:01.755
- It was a failure. - What do you think?

1513
00:58:01.755 --> 00:58:04.056
It remains as a beautiful memory.

1514
00:58:05.125 --> 00:58:08.056
At least I wasn't the last one to go home.

1515
00:58:08.056 --> 00:58:09.665
- Right. - That's for certain.

1516
00:58:09.665 --> 00:58:10.665
Right.

1517
00:58:10.665 --> 00:58:14.636
By the way, Seok Hoon was as frequently mentioned...

1518
00:58:14.636 --> 00:58:16.435
as Kyung Ho.

1519
00:58:16.435 --> 00:58:19.435
You succeeded, but it was very awkward.

1520
00:58:19.835 --> 00:58:22.906
- Right. - Should we count it as a success?

1521
00:58:22.906 --> 00:58:24.145
Was it right for us to let him go?

1522
00:58:24.346 --> 00:58:27.116
Was it right for Seok Hoon to leave because we told him to go?

1523
00:58:27.545 --> 00:58:29.446
- We were perplexed. - His definition of success...

1524
00:58:29.446 --> 00:58:31.116
- was different. - Right.

1525
00:58:31.116 --> 00:58:33.716
You defined "success" again.

1526
00:58:33.716 --> 00:58:36.556
- It was uncertain. - You set a precedent.

1527
00:58:36.656 --> 00:58:38.685
It was my first time in 10 years to be on Happy Together.

1528
00:58:38.685 --> 00:58:40.826
- Right. - I am very proud...

1529
00:58:40.826 --> 00:58:43.266
about my big accomplishment.

1530
00:58:43.266 --> 00:58:45.025
- What did you accomplish? - What accomplishment?

1531
00:58:45.025 --> 00:58:46.335
- Anyway, he succeeded. - It showed me I have something.

1532
00:58:46.335 --> 00:58:48.636
I had succeeded to go home.

1533
00:58:48.636 --> 00:58:52.636
- Right. - I still remember that situation.

1534
00:58:52.636 --> 00:58:55.576
When you entered the room,

1535
00:58:55.576 --> 00:58:58.045
the customers didn't recognize you.

1536
00:58:58.045 --> 00:59:00.645
- You sang there and... - It's not that they didn't know me.

1537
00:59:00.645 --> 00:59:03.716
When I thought about it, I realized that they were very nervous.

1538
00:59:03.946 --> 00:59:04.946
Were they?

1539
00:59:05.116 --> 00:59:07.656
- I think we can say that. - My gosh.

1540
00:59:07.656 --> 00:59:09.656
There was something else that happened in there.

1541
00:59:09.855 --> 00:59:12.525
The girls were pushing each other to sing the song.

1542
00:59:13.056 --> 00:59:14.726
- "I don't know this song." - This was the problem.

1543
00:59:14.726 --> 00:59:16.665
They stared at the video.

1544
00:59:16.665 --> 00:59:18.625
They didn't know the song.

1545
00:59:18.625 --> 00:59:20.966
Let's say, if someone sings your song,

1546
00:59:21.196 --> 00:59:24.335
but doesn't recognize you, then you fail.

1547
00:59:25.005 --> 00:59:27.235
Let's do that. That's a good idea.

1548
00:59:27.235 --> 00:59:30.545
- That's too mean. - We're here to save our honor.

1549
00:59:30.545 --> 00:59:32.915
Everyone knows these two.

1550
00:59:32.915 --> 00:59:33.915
- But... - Seok Hoon...

1551
00:59:33.915 --> 00:59:36.545
Seok Hoon didn't fail last time.

1552
00:59:36.545 --> 00:59:37.946
I didn't fail.

1553
00:59:37.946 --> 00:59:39.755
- Those who are watching... - You must've known...

1554
00:59:39.755 --> 00:59:41.855
- what this episode was about. - He was the third one to go home.

1555
00:59:41.855 --> 00:59:45.185
- Why did you agree to come? - You should've turned it down.

1556
00:59:45.185 --> 00:59:47.696
I like being on TV.

1557
00:59:50.596 --> 00:59:52.125
I love it. It felt good.

1558
00:59:52.125 --> 00:59:54.466
- That's good. That's good. - I thanked them.

1559
00:59:54.466 --> 00:59:56.935
- That's all that matters.

1560
00:59:56.935 --> 00:59:59.136
- He's very positive. - It's lovely.

1561
00:59:59.136 --> 01:00:02.335
Last time, he was very confident.

1562
01:00:02.335 --> 01:00:04.705
- He was. - He said he wouldn't...

1563
01:00:04.705 --> 01:00:07.846
count the songs SG Wannabe sang before he joined.

1564
01:00:07.846 --> 01:00:09.846
- You have to talk about that first. - That's important.

1565
01:00:09.846 --> 01:00:13.286
- Only the songs he sang. - Only the ones he sang.

1566
01:00:13.286 --> 01:00:16.326
He said he'd only count the songs he sang.

1567
01:00:16.386 --> 01:00:19.056
A lot of people sang SG Wannabe's songs.

1568
01:00:19.056 --> 01:00:22.326
And we got up every time they chose it. His face turned red.

1569
01:00:23.196 --> 01:00:25.366
- What will you do today? - This is very important.

1570
01:00:25.366 --> 01:00:28.696
Will you also count the songs SG Wannabe sang before you joined?

1571
01:00:28.696 --> 01:00:29.766
Yes, I will count them.

1572
01:00:31.605 --> 01:00:33.005
(Seok Hoon has changed.)

1573
01:00:33.005 --> 01:00:35.076
- But that is... - He's confident.

1574
01:00:35.076 --> 01:00:37.275
not fair for us.

1575
01:00:37.275 --> 01:00:38.846
That's not true.

1576
01:00:38.846 --> 01:00:41.875
When everyone is here,

1577
01:00:41.946 --> 01:00:43.386
let's set the rule.

1578
01:00:43.386 --> 01:00:45.216
Why would you make the call?

1579
01:00:45.216 --> 01:00:46.915
- I want to count them. - We should all vote.

1580
01:00:46.915 --> 01:00:48.485
- We should all vote. - We all have to agree to it.

1581
01:00:48.485 --> 01:00:50.585
- He's willing to sing them. - He's given up his pride.

1582
01:00:50.585 --> 01:00:53.156
- It was a difficult decision. - I want to do it.

1583
01:00:53.156 --> 01:00:55.926
- I want to sing them. - What else?

1584
01:00:56.025 --> 01:00:58.326
I want to count the songs that were sung by many artists.

1585
01:00:58.326 --> 01:00:59.996
- You can't do that. - You can't.

1586
01:00:59.996 --> 01:01:02.136
- I will count everything. - We will count everything.

1587
01:01:02.136 --> 01:01:03.906
- I will sing anything. - Even if it's an omnibus album?

1588
01:01:03.906 --> 01:01:05.335
We are going to push for everything.

1589
01:01:05.335 --> 01:01:06.636
Have you sung duets?

1590
01:01:06.636 --> 01:01:08.705
- I've seen a lot of duets. - We will count all of those.

1591
01:01:08.835 --> 01:01:11.446
Anyway, Seok Hoon has joined us.

1592
01:01:11.446 --> 01:01:12.705
Let's do better today.

1593
01:01:12.705 --> 01:01:16.246
- Let's do this. - Let's check the last room.

1594
01:01:16.346 --> 01:01:18.216
- It's Soo Yong's partner. - Yes.

1595
01:01:19.216 --> 01:01:20.556
- It's a woman. - It's a woman.

1596
01:01:20.755 --> 01:01:22.016
Is it Gummy or Lyn?

1597
01:01:22.016 --> 01:01:23.056
It's Lyn.

1598
01:01:23.455 --> 01:01:25.226
- It's Lyn. - It's Lyn.

1599
01:01:25.226 --> 01:01:26.826
- It's her voice. - It's Lyn.

1600
01:01:26.826 --> 01:01:29.025
("Like Being Shot by a Bullet")

1601
01:01:29.795 --> 01:01:31.625
(Like being shot by a bullet)

1602
01:01:34.165 --> 01:01:37.636
(She's the only female guest.)

1603
01:01:39.335 --> 01:01:41.906
(How did she end up here?)

1604
01:01:42.176 --> 01:01:45.176
(She was happy the whole time,)

1605
01:01:46.676 --> 01:01:48.846
(but she ended up being the last one to go home.)

1606
01:01:50.585 --> 01:01:53.156
(She even got a chance to sing a song.)

1607
01:01:55.085 --> 01:01:57.226
(But it was useless.)

1608
01:02:01.525 --> 01:02:05.266
(No matter how hard she tried,)

1609
01:02:06.895 --> 01:02:09.536
(she couldn't make the customers stay.)

1610
01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:14.400

1611
01:02:14.476 --> 01:02:17.205
(If she could go back in time, she would go back to the time...)

1612
01:02:17.676 --> 01:02:19.375
(before she agreed to come to this show.)

1613
01:02:22.775 --> 01:02:26.755
(Today, the queen of drama soundtrack will recover her honor.)

1614
01:02:30.185 --> 01:02:32.556
(The 4th ending singer is Lyn.)

1615
01:02:34.326 --> 01:02:36.326
(Kim Soo Yong and Lyn)

1616
01:02:36.696 --> 01:02:38.996
- It's Lyn. - Lyn.

1617
01:02:39.196 --> 01:02:40.636
She's become more beautiful.

1618
01:02:40.636 --> 01:02:42.735
She's beautiful.

1619
01:02:42.735 --> 01:02:45.406
- Your hair is dyed well. - My hair.

1620
01:02:45.935 --> 01:02:47.275
- He says her hair is dyed well. - Weren't you...

1621
01:02:47.275 --> 01:02:49.906
- trying to dye your hair like hers? - I was.

1622
01:02:49.906 --> 01:02:51.576
- The colors are similar. - Right.

1623
01:02:51.576 --> 01:02:52.915
- I wanted the wine color. - The wine color.

1624
01:02:52.915 --> 01:02:55.145
That's the color I wanted.

1625
01:02:55.315 --> 01:02:57.645
This is going to be fun.

1626
01:02:58.246 --> 01:03:00.455
We feel comfortable about nitpicking at each other.

1627
01:03:00.455 --> 01:03:03.255
I never expected Lyn to be here.

1628
01:03:03.255 --> 01:03:04.455
- Lyn. - Right.

1629
01:03:04.455 --> 01:03:07.226
We expected her to go home first.

1630
01:03:07.226 --> 01:03:08.895
But she ended up being the last.

1631
01:03:08.895 --> 01:03:10.426
A lot of people sang your song before we began.

1632
01:03:10.426 --> 01:03:13.536
- Right. - How did it feel after the show?

1633
01:03:13.536 --> 01:03:16.466
It was horrible.

1634
01:03:17.205 --> 01:03:18.636
- Lyn, - It was horrible.

1635
01:03:18.636 --> 01:03:21.176
don't say this when we're all here.

1636
01:03:21.435 --> 01:03:22.806
- That's exactly how she felt. - The cameras are watching us.

1637
01:03:22.806 --> 01:03:23.946
- Great. - Right.

1638
01:03:23.946 --> 01:03:25.645
I am just as hot-tempered as you are, you see?

1639
01:03:27.267 --> 01:03:31.167
I watched the show on its original airing time.

1640
01:03:31.167 --> 01:03:33.966
I get very obsessed about these things.

1641
01:03:33.966 --> 01:03:38.176
Everyone was expecting me to go home.

1642
01:03:38.176 --> 01:03:40.776
- Right. - It made me feel really bad.

1643
01:03:40.776 --> 01:03:43.046
- It was hard to watch. - You knew the result.

1644
01:03:43.046 --> 01:03:45.486
I knew what happened.

1645
01:03:45.486 --> 01:03:48.017
And I can't forget about one thing.

1646
01:03:48.017 --> 01:03:50.256
That day, I was wearing hair extensions.

1647
01:03:50.386 --> 01:03:53.557
And towards the end, my real hair stuck out, and I looked ugly.

1648
01:03:53.587 --> 01:03:56.196
People were giving comments about my poor hair.

1649
01:03:56.196 --> 01:03:58.296
- Really? - There were so many comments.

1650
01:03:58.296 --> 01:03:59.296
Really?

1651
01:03:59.296 --> 01:04:01.526
I nearly fired my hairdresser.

1652
01:04:03.567 --> 01:04:05.906
Nothing worked out that day.

1653
01:04:05.906 --> 01:04:08.377
- Nothing worked out. - Nothing worked out.

1654
01:04:08.377 --> 01:04:11.037
By the way, I heard you called Seok Hoon and yelled at him.

1655
01:04:11.037 --> 01:04:13.107
- Why? - I called her.

1656
01:04:13.107 --> 01:04:16.346
Seok Hoon called me the day we had the shoot.

1657
01:04:16.676 --> 01:04:17.676
I was feeling bad because I was the last one to go.

1658
01:04:17.676 --> 01:04:21.087
But actually, he barely got to go home.

1659
01:04:21.087 --> 01:04:23.156
He almost didn't make it.

1660
01:04:23.156 --> 01:04:24.317
- Come on. - You almost didn't.

1661
01:04:24.317 --> 01:04:26.486
- Yes. - That's not true.

1662
01:04:26.486 --> 01:04:28.026
She's right. He barely made it.

1663
01:04:28.026 --> 01:04:30.326
He barely made it and went home.

1664
01:04:30.397 --> 01:04:33.926
I was embarrassed, and I felt sorry to you all.

1665
01:04:34.497 --> 01:04:37.267
On the way home, I felt really bad.

1666
01:04:37.267 --> 01:04:39.136
And Seok Hoon called me...

1667
01:04:39.136 --> 01:04:40.937
and told me I did well.

1668
01:04:41.406 --> 01:04:44.636
What did people say to you after the show aired?

1669
01:04:45.006 --> 01:04:46.946
- People felt sorry for me. - Sorry for you?

1670
01:04:46.946 --> 01:04:49.317
- Yes. - Whenever I went to an event,

1671
01:04:49.317 --> 01:04:51.276
people treated me with pity.

1672
01:04:52.287 --> 01:04:55.187
I had a performance scheduled in Hong Kong.

1673
01:04:55.187 --> 01:04:57.787
The interpreter was from Hong Kong.

1674
01:04:58.326 --> 01:04:59.557
- Did he watch it? - Yes.

1675
01:04:59.557 --> 01:05:01.857
- Yes, he did. - Did he watch it in Hong Kong?

1676
01:05:01.897 --> 01:05:04.897
I guess many people watch this show from abroad.

1677
01:05:05.067 --> 01:05:07.426
He comforted me and told me...

1678
01:05:07.667 --> 01:05:10.736
I'd be able to go home early next time...

1679
01:05:10.736 --> 01:05:13.267
- if I perform in Hong Kong. - Really?

1680
01:05:13.267 --> 01:05:15.037
- People in Hong Kong saw it too. - It didn't make me feel better.

1681
01:05:16.837 --> 01:05:19.307
Did Tae Woo recommend you to come here?

1682
01:05:19.307 --> 01:05:23.317
He kept saying how fun it was.

1683
01:05:23.317 --> 01:05:26.046
- It was fun. - I enjoyed it a lot.

1684
01:05:26.046 --> 01:05:29.687
We met at an event, and he asked me what happened.

1685
01:05:29.687 --> 01:05:32.687
I told him that I came last and that I couldn't believe it.

1686
01:05:33.227 --> 01:05:35.296
And he said that's what happens to everybody.

1687
01:05:35.296 --> 01:05:38.026
I think he was smirking.

1688
01:05:38.026 --> 01:05:40.196
- Wait. - "I came last too."

1689
01:05:40.196 --> 01:05:42.267
That's the day Seok Hoon came third, right?

1690
01:05:42.267 --> 01:05:44.267
- He ranked third. - Coming last is better.

1691
01:05:44.296 --> 01:05:46.366
- Why? - He barely made it.

1692
01:05:46.366 --> 01:05:48.377
(So it's better to just come last.)

1693
01:05:49.406 --> 01:05:52.506
It's established that Seok Hoon had barely come third.

1694
01:05:54.406 --> 01:05:56.176
(He's a member of the best vocalist group SG Wannabe.)

1695
01:05:57.477 --> 01:05:59.317
(He's a vocal trainer of Wanna One.)

1696
01:06:00.386 --> 01:06:01.986
(And he's humiliated.)

1697
01:06:02.486 --> 01:06:04.616
The word "barely" might come up when you search for your name.

1698
01:06:04.656 --> 01:06:08.057
- Don't be alarmed. - They look more relaxed.

1699
01:06:08.057 --> 01:06:10.696
The people who have seen the show might get confused.

1700
01:06:10.696 --> 01:06:12.596
I was the third one to go home.

1701
01:06:12.596 --> 01:06:14.696
- I didn't fail. - You managed to go home.

1702
01:06:14.696 --> 01:06:15.696
(I am no loser.)

1703
01:06:15.897 --> 01:06:18.466
Why are you here then? You are here.

1704
01:06:18.466 --> 01:06:21.267
This is a special for the singers who couldn't go home.

1705
01:06:21.267 --> 01:06:23.107
- It's a special for them. - It's a special for us.

1706
01:06:23.207 --> 01:06:25.576
But Seok Hoon did manage to go home.

1707
01:06:25.576 --> 01:06:28.276
Even though he did manage to go home,

1708
01:06:28.276 --> 01:06:30.747
he had stronger presence than those who went home last.

1709
01:06:30.747 --> 01:06:33.446
When that happens to you, you feel very uncomfortable.

1710
01:06:33.446 --> 01:06:35.787
- You feel very uncomfortable. - By the way,

1711
01:06:35.787 --> 01:06:38.486
Gummy was the last one to go too.

1712
01:06:38.486 --> 01:06:40.486
I know.

1713
01:06:40.486 --> 01:06:42.696
- She was the last. - The ones born in 1981 did badly.

1714
01:06:42.696 --> 01:06:44.057
Was Wheesung third one to go home?

1715
01:06:44.057 --> 01:06:48.196
When the singers born in 1981 team up with Seok Jin, this happens.

1716
01:06:48.196 --> 01:06:51.167
It's always like that. What year were you born?

1717
01:06:51.167 --> 01:06:53.006
- He was born in 1981 too. - Poor Tae Woo.

1718
01:06:53.006 --> 01:06:56.607
- They are cursed. - When they are with me, they fail.

1719
01:06:56.837 --> 01:06:58.346
- They always fail with him. - Seok Jin,

1720
01:06:58.346 --> 01:07:00.377
What on earth happened in 1981?

1721
01:07:00.377 --> 01:07:02.317
- In 1981? - Did you release an album in 1981?

1722
01:07:02.317 --> 01:07:03.817
No, I was too young then.

1723
01:07:04.817 --> 01:07:07.517
- No, that wasn't the year. - Today...

1724
01:07:07.517 --> 01:07:09.716
No, I think it was 1981. It must be 1981.

1725
01:07:09.716 --> 01:07:11.926
Am I as old as Na Hoon A? Why would I release it then?

1726
01:07:11.926 --> 01:07:14.057
- You were in middle school then. - Right.

1727
01:07:14.386 --> 01:07:16.397
Is there a gift for the last singer today?

1728
01:07:16.656 --> 01:07:18.526
- Today will be the worst. - I'd hate that.

1729
01:07:18.526 --> 01:07:19.526
Today's last singer...

1730
01:07:19.526 --> 01:07:21.627
- will be so sad. - It's the ultimate match.

1731
01:07:21.627 --> 01:07:23.437
I really hope we'd give an award to the singer.

1732
01:07:23.437 --> 01:07:26.236
- It's like we're selecting a king. - That's right.

1733
01:07:26.236 --> 01:07:29.037
- We always select the best one. - It's the best of the best.

1734
01:07:29.037 --> 01:07:31.846
- Today's last singer will be that. - The king of the finale.

1735
01:07:31.846 --> 01:07:34.406
I briefly mentioned this earlier. We are in Yeoksam today.

1736
01:07:34.406 --> 01:07:36.747
- Yeoksam. - Are you happy with this area?

1737
01:07:36.747 --> 01:07:38.147
- I like Yeoksam. - It's a great area.

1738
01:07:38.147 --> 01:07:40.247
Anyway, you mentioned this area in previous episodes.

1739
01:07:40.247 --> 01:07:41.616
- That's right. - So this is why we are here.

1740
01:07:41.616 --> 01:07:44.656
- You brought up Yeoksam, Kyung Ho. - He did indeed.

1741
01:07:44.656 --> 01:07:46.326
Everyone, we are here.

1742
01:07:46.986 --> 01:07:48.857
(People in their mid 30s to late 40s)

1743
01:07:48.957 --> 01:07:49.957
(Yeouido, Gwanghwamun)

1744
01:07:49.957 --> 01:07:50.957
(Yeoksam-dong)

1745
01:07:52.426 --> 01:07:54.497
(They have been wanting to come to this neighborhood.)

1746
01:07:55.837 --> 01:07:58.196
(The sacred place of office workers)

1747
01:07:58.707 --> 01:08:00.167
(Their pride is at stake on this battle.)

1748
01:08:00.267 --> 01:08:01.906
- So today... - Is everyone okay with this?

1749
01:08:01.906 --> 01:08:02.977
Yes, I like it.

1750
01:08:02.977 --> 01:08:05.307
One of the singers will be the last one to go, which is bound to happen.

1751
01:08:05.307 --> 01:08:06.777
- Yes, that's true. - However,

1752
01:08:06.777 --> 01:08:08.206
- Everyone got off work last time. - everyone got off work last time.

1753
01:08:08.206 --> 01:08:09.246
(It was unprecedented.)

1754
01:08:09.246 --> 01:08:10.777
- They didn't even use the chances. - I'm worried about this.

1755
01:08:10.777 --> 01:08:13.786
I'm worried that no one might be able to get off work today.

1756
01:08:15.117 --> 01:08:16.886
(It will be a new legend.)

1757
01:08:16.886 --> 01:08:18.827
- That has never happened so far. - Exactly.

1758
01:08:18.827 --> 01:08:20.386
Everyone can enjoy the late night snacks.

1759
01:08:20.386 --> 01:08:21.827
- We won't be lonely at least. - That's great.

1760
01:08:21.827 --> 01:08:23.027
That'd be awesome.

1761
01:08:23.027 --> 01:08:25.867
Everyone can sing the last song together. How nice.

1762
01:08:25.867 --> 01:08:28.897
- We can sing "Hand in Hand". - It's a music festival.

1763
01:08:29.397 --> 01:08:31.496
- Among singers, - Yes?

1764
01:08:31.496 --> 01:08:34.367
- singing last is the best. - It's the best they could ask for.

1765
01:08:34.367 --> 01:08:35.977
But things are strange on this show.

1766
01:08:36.437 --> 01:08:38.346
Lyn, who do you think will get off work last?

1767
01:08:38.346 --> 01:08:40.277
To be honest, I don't care as long as it's not me.

1768
01:08:40.277 --> 01:08:43.017
I just want to beat Lee Seok Hoon. He almost forced his success.

1769
01:08:44.147 --> 01:08:45.716
- You mean from the other episode? - From the other episode?

1770
01:08:45.716 --> 01:08:46.716
- You're holding a grudge. - Last time...

1771
01:08:46.716 --> 01:08:49.386
- You forced his way around it. - It bruised my pride.

1772
01:08:49.386 --> 01:08:51.857
- You want to go before Seok Hoon. - She just wants to beat him.

1773
01:08:51.857 --> 01:08:54.727
Kyung Ho, what about you? Which singer will get off last?

1774
01:08:56.096 --> 01:08:57.327
Seok Hoon.

1775
01:08:57.327 --> 01:08:58.367
I'm sorry.

1776
01:08:59.027 --> 01:09:01.067
(Part 2 of "Beating Lee Seok Hoon")

1777
01:09:01.527 --> 01:09:03.466
This is why we invited him even though he went home third.

1778
01:09:03.466 --> 01:09:06.006
- This is why. - I'm not looking down on you.

1779
01:09:06.006 --> 01:09:08.166
Both of them named Seok Hoon as the last singer.

1780
01:09:08.166 --> 01:09:09.777
- This is shocking. - That's highly likely.

1781
01:09:09.777 --> 01:09:11.077
- His opinion might be different. - How dare you name my partner?

1782
01:09:11.077 --> 01:09:12.376
What do you think, Seok Hoon?

1783
01:09:13.147 --> 01:09:14.607
Truthfully,

1784
01:09:16.317 --> 01:09:18.786
I would feel at ease if I were to get off last.

1785
01:09:19.487 --> 01:09:23.017
If I take the third place and all of you say that I forced my way out,

1786
01:09:23.216 --> 01:09:25.256
- then I'll go home last. - He's upset.

1787
01:09:25.357 --> 01:09:27.157
He sounds upset.

1788
01:09:27.157 --> 01:09:29.157
- He's mad from the beginning. - My gosh.

1789
01:09:29.157 --> 01:09:31.157
- His true colors are showing. - He had a lot of pent-up anger.

1790
01:09:31.157 --> 01:09:35.096
If you won't acknowledge my success, I will go last. I won't do it.

1791
01:09:35.096 --> 01:09:37.036
- What about you, Tae Ho? - You'd rather do that instead.

1792
01:09:37.036 --> 01:09:38.737
- Which singer will get off last? - All right. Great.

1793
01:09:38.737 --> 01:09:39.807
Seok Hoon.

1794
01:09:40.767 --> 01:09:41.836
Seok Hoon is having a hard time.

1795
01:09:41.836 --> 01:09:44.407
- How can you gang up on him? - Is it a special for Seok Hoon?

1796
01:09:44.536 --> 01:09:45.577
Let's give him a break.

1797
01:09:45.577 --> 01:09:48.046
Seok Hoon, why don't you name a singer too?

1798
01:09:48.046 --> 01:09:49.577
I get the feeling he will be the last singer.

1799
01:09:50.617 --> 01:09:53.216
- You think I'll be last? - Yes, he said that.

1800
01:09:54.046 --> 01:09:55.057
- He's popular among today's guests. - Today is...

1801
01:09:55.057 --> 01:09:56.786
Friday though.

1802
01:09:57.187 --> 01:09:59.327
- Friday night - Friday night

1803
01:09:59.327 --> 01:10:01.286
- You starred on a Friday too. - Didn't you star on a Friday?

1804
01:10:01.286 --> 01:10:02.296
Duly noted.

1805
01:10:03.057 --> 01:10:04.697
- It was Friday night then. - That's right.

1806
01:10:04.697 --> 01:10:05.697
Yes, it was indeed.

1807
01:10:05.827 --> 01:10:08.296
What's more is that it was about to rain too.

1808
01:10:08.437 --> 01:10:09.567
Even "Love Rain"...

1809
01:10:09.567 --> 01:10:11.096
It was a great Friday.

1810
01:10:11.096 --> 01:10:13.006
- I was so confident that day. - Okay.

1811
01:10:13.636 --> 01:10:15.636
- Things were going my way. - That was a good point.

1812
01:10:16.277 --> 01:10:17.807
- He might be the last singer. - Okay.

1813
01:10:17.807 --> 01:10:19.777
Lyn, which singer do you think might take the first place?

1814
01:10:19.777 --> 01:10:22.416
I think Kyung Ho might be first.

1815
01:10:22.416 --> 01:10:23.916
- No, I won't be first. - because...

1816
01:10:23.916 --> 01:10:25.886
- I saw the episode he starred on. - That's a possibility.

1817
01:10:25.886 --> 01:10:27.687
I did feel sad for him.

1818
01:10:28.187 --> 01:10:29.187
Was it that bad?

1819
01:10:29.187 --> 01:10:31.216
- But I was sad for him that day. - I get it.

1820
01:10:31.216 --> 01:10:34.626
- After the episode aired, - You did well.

1821
01:10:34.626 --> 01:10:38.256
a lot of people started to sing Kyung Ho's songs.

1822
01:10:38.256 --> 01:10:41.426
It's true. After that episode, rankings for his songs went up.

1823
01:10:41.426 --> 01:10:42.996
- His songs climbed the charts. - They did.

1824
01:10:42.996 --> 01:10:45.836
- People help the less fortunate. - That's true.

1825
01:10:47.107 --> 01:10:48.136
- You have a point. - You're teasing him.

1826
01:10:48.237 --> 01:10:50.737
- Koreans are really warmhearted. - Our citizens like to help indeed.

1827
01:10:50.737 --> 01:10:52.407
- They are very affectionate. - Exactly.

1828
01:10:52.407 --> 01:10:56.246
I think today's last singer shouldn't beat him or herself up.

1829
01:10:56.246 --> 01:10:59.286
Soo Yong, who's exclusively appearing on Happy Together,

1830
01:10:59.286 --> 01:11:01.117
- guess which one will leave first? - "Exclusively"?

1831
01:11:01.117 --> 01:11:02.157
You're amazing.

1832
01:11:02.687 --> 01:11:03.716
(You're amazing.)

1833
01:11:04.357 --> 01:11:06.286
(Blushing)

1834
01:11:06.286 --> 01:11:07.357
Lyn, you're doing great.

1835
01:11:08.086 --> 01:11:09.256
That's so cool.

1836
01:11:10.227 --> 01:11:11.626
He's the Get-off-work Fairy,

1837
01:11:11.626 --> 01:11:13.067
- so you have a great chance. - Right.

1838
01:11:13.067 --> 01:11:14.267
- I have a good feeling about this. - Okay.

1839
01:11:14.267 --> 01:11:15.397
(With him, you'll get off 1st.)

1840
01:11:15.397 --> 01:11:18.067
Kyung Ho, which singer do you think will get off first?

1841
01:11:18.607 --> 01:11:20.506
I think Tae Woo might get off work first today.

1842
01:11:21.336 --> 01:11:23.477
I think Tae Woo will get off work with his song, "Love Rain".

1843
01:11:23.477 --> 01:11:24.676
(Kyung Ho guesses "Love Rain" will be sung.)

1844
01:11:25.346 --> 01:11:26.376
Who will be next?

1845
01:11:26.376 --> 01:11:27.447
Who will be next?

1846
01:11:27.447 --> 01:11:28.916
- I'll get off 2nd. - You'll be 2nd.

1847
01:11:29.317 --> 01:11:30.477
What about third place?

1848
01:11:30.477 --> 01:11:31.846
- He already said that. - Lyn.

1849
01:11:32.746 --> 01:11:34.886
- Seok Hoon will be fourth. - That's so awkward.

1850
01:11:35.086 --> 01:11:36.987
He guessed Lyn to be the third one to leave because...

1851
01:11:37.586 --> 01:11:39.586
her songs are very old.

1852
01:11:40.487 --> 01:11:43.727
- Seriously? - He asked when they were released.

1853
01:11:44.426 --> 01:11:46.596
- Come on, Kyung Ho. - He said that during the interview?

1854
01:11:46.596 --> 01:11:49.966
You were quite harsh on her during the interview.

1855
01:11:49.966 --> 01:11:51.706
- What's your problem? - He said her songs are old.

1856
01:11:51.706 --> 01:11:54.067
- What? Whom are you talking to? - You were mean.

1857
01:11:54.067 --> 01:11:56.577
- My gosh, What a surprise. - So her songs aren't popular?

1858
01:11:56.577 --> 01:11:59.147
The soundtracks might be old, but I'll succeed with a soundtrack.

1859
01:11:59.506 --> 01:12:02.117
(She won't let that go.)

1860
01:12:02.777 --> 01:12:04.746
- I know they are quite old. - I did mention your soundtracks.

1861
01:12:04.746 --> 01:12:07.817
- They've been around for ages. - That's what I said too.

1862
01:12:07.817 --> 01:12:09.687
- Lyn, are you being sarcastic? - Yes?

1863
01:12:09.687 --> 01:12:11.987
- No, how could I be? - That's not how I said it.

1864
01:12:11.987 --> 01:12:14.527
- Lyn holds grudges. - No, not at all.

1865
01:12:14.527 --> 01:12:16.357
- You don't, right? - We like that expression. Great.

1866
01:12:16.756 --> 01:12:17.857
When were the soundtracks...

1867
01:12:17.857 --> 01:12:20.897
- released? - They are such old soundtracks.

1868
01:12:20.897 --> 01:12:23.496
Outdated soundtracks from a long time ago.

1869
01:12:23.496 --> 01:12:25.166
- They are outdated. - I didn't use that term.

1870
01:12:25.166 --> 01:12:26.307
- They are such old songs. - I just said they passed its time.

1871
01:12:26.307 --> 01:12:29.176
- Stop it, please. - Yes, her songs may be old.

1872
01:12:29.176 --> 01:12:31.536
- Gosh, give me a break, will you? - That's enough.

1873
01:12:32.546 --> 01:12:33.546
Kyung Ho.

1874
01:12:33.977 --> 01:12:35.647
Didn't you release your songs about 20 years ago?

1875
01:12:36.916 --> 01:12:39.517
- That's right. They did indeed. - I sang them in middle school.

1876
01:12:40.046 --> 01:12:41.046
Right.

1877
01:12:41.046 --> 01:12:43.456
I listened to his songs before I got married.

1878
01:12:43.456 --> 01:12:44.557
- I forgot about that. - Fine.

1879
01:12:45.057 --> 01:12:46.586
What do you think, Seok Hoon?

1880
01:12:46.586 --> 01:12:49.926
I saw Kyung Ho's episode.

1881
01:12:50.527 --> 01:12:52.267
It broke my heart. I'm serious.

1882
01:12:53.827 --> 01:12:56.496
- Actually... The truth is... - Wait.

1883
01:12:56.496 --> 01:12:58.506
- He got unexpectedly serious. - It's just that...

1884
01:12:58.506 --> 01:12:59.737
I feel so bad for him.

1885
01:12:59.737 --> 01:13:01.777
You guys all know this probably. When we were growing up...

1886
01:13:01.777 --> 01:13:03.876
- Should I retire now? - No, no.

1887
01:13:03.876 --> 01:13:05.607
- Please hear me out. - Will this decide...

1888
01:13:05.607 --> 01:13:07.376
- my retirement? - No, no.

1889
01:13:07.376 --> 01:13:09.117
- Let him finish. - When I was in high school,

1890
01:13:09.117 --> 01:13:11.617
- Edit out my part. - every guy was Kyung Ho's fan.

1891
01:13:11.617 --> 01:13:14.317
- That's so true. - Everyone loved his songs.

1892
01:13:14.317 --> 01:13:17.756
We all sang his "Forbidden Love" and his other songs.

1893
01:13:17.756 --> 01:13:20.626
The singer I have so much respect for starred on the show,

1894
01:13:20.626 --> 01:13:22.596
but he lashed out on other people.

1895
01:13:23.626 --> 01:13:25.767
(Angry Kyung Ho)

1896
01:13:26.727 --> 01:13:28.966
So I thought it'd be nice...

1897
01:13:28.966 --> 01:13:31.937
if he would get off work first and continue afterwards,

1898
01:13:31.937 --> 01:13:34.067
but since Lyn is the only female singer here,

1899
01:13:34.466 --> 01:13:37.376
- I hope she'd get off work 1st. - So Lyn would be 1st?

1900
01:13:37.376 --> 01:13:39.607
And I'd like to have this match among just guys.

1901
01:13:40.676 --> 01:13:43.447
- Okay. What about you, Tae Woo? - I see.

1902
01:13:43.447 --> 01:13:44.777
I think Kyung Ho will get off first...

1903
01:13:45.447 --> 01:13:47.187
- Do you mean that? - because when I was waiting,

1904
01:13:47.187 --> 01:13:50.017
- people here sang old songs. - Is that so?

1905
01:13:50.017 --> 01:13:52.456
So I reckon someone will sing "Forbidden Love" today.

1906
01:13:52.956 --> 01:13:55.426
Let's guess with which song you'll be able to get off today.

1907
01:13:55.426 --> 01:13:57.096
What about you, Kyung Ho?

1908
01:13:57.096 --> 01:13:58.227
I mean, my songs are...

1909
01:13:58.227 --> 01:14:00.227
I'm looking forward to this today, but I have a problem.

1910
01:14:00.626 --> 01:14:02.496
I have to run to the room as soon as my song is played.

1911
01:14:03.596 --> 01:14:05.567
I've seen a lot of people do this with my songs.

1912
01:14:05.567 --> 01:14:06.607
- Do they stop midway? - They won't finish?

1913
01:14:06.607 --> 01:14:07.666
- They stop in the middle. - That's right.

1914
01:14:07.666 --> 01:14:10.277
- It's because his songs are hard. - You have to keep raising the key.

1915
01:14:10.277 --> 01:14:13.077
- That's true. - So they end up canceling the song.

1916
01:14:13.246 --> 01:14:15.916
- What about you, Seok Hoon? - That would feel horrible.

1917
01:14:15.916 --> 01:14:18.786
Well, I mean... This song isn't that popular these days.

1918
01:14:19.017 --> 01:14:20.916
- It will be an SG Wannabe's song. - SG Wannabe's songs?

1919
01:14:21.517 --> 01:14:22.857
- That's great. - That would be neat.

1920
01:14:23.216 --> 01:14:25.327
- What about you, Tae Woo? - It will probably be "One Candle".

1921
01:14:25.327 --> 01:14:27.557
- "One Candle". - I'll keep my hopes up for it.

1922
01:14:28.256 --> 01:14:31.496
- Everyone has their own theme. - Do you guys have winter songs?

1923
01:14:31.496 --> 01:14:33.027
- Do you have seasonal songs? - Right. Do you have those?

1924
01:14:33.027 --> 01:14:34.367
- I have some. - Didn't you sing carols?

1925
01:14:34.367 --> 01:14:37.267
- I sang "Because It's Christmas". - Seok Hoon has one.

1926
01:14:37.267 --> 01:14:39.737
Sung Si Kyung, Park Hyo Shin, Seo In Guk, Vixx,

1927
01:14:39.737 --> 01:14:41.336
- and I sang the song together. - What's the name of the song?

1928
01:14:41.336 --> 01:14:44.636
Then you don't have a lot of parts for the song.

1929
01:14:44.636 --> 01:14:45.977
- I have a lot of parts. - Did you get to open your mouth?

1930
01:14:45.977 --> 01:14:47.006
- I have a lot of parts. - You do?

1931
01:14:47.006 --> 01:14:49.246
Yes, I do. This song deserves to be included.

1932
01:14:49.246 --> 01:14:51.246
When it's winter, people start listening to it.

1933
01:14:51.246 --> 01:14:53.046
- The song climbs the charts. - Is that so?

1934
01:14:53.046 --> 01:14:54.716
- I checked the Popular Songs Chart. - Is it in the chart?

1935
01:14:54.716 --> 01:14:55.756
Yes. The ranking is not bad.

1936
01:14:55.756 --> 01:14:58.157
- My gosh, this is unexpected. - It's a winter song, not a carol?

1937
01:14:58.157 --> 01:14:59.657
- Do you have one, Kyung Ho? - No, I don't.

1938
01:14:59.657 --> 01:15:01.357
- Do you have one, Kyung Ho? - No, I don't.

1939
01:15:01.357 --> 01:15:02.357
I'm a rocker.

1940
01:15:05.096 --> 01:15:07.496
- That's right. - He can't say he's even cold.

1941
01:15:07.496 --> 01:15:09.496
- Rockers can't feel the cold. - They can't be cold.

1942
01:15:09.496 --> 01:15:11.336
- That's right. - That's the spirit of rock music.

1943
01:15:11.567 --> 01:15:13.136
Of course. How could he admit that he's cold?

1944
01:15:13.607 --> 01:15:16.277
(I'll dance to "Pick Me", but I can't sing a Christmas carol.)

1945
01:15:16.836 --> 01:15:19.376
I would like to sing carols too, but I don't think it will work.

1946
01:15:19.807 --> 01:15:21.246
- Is that why? - He's adorable.

1947
01:15:21.246 --> 01:15:22.777
I'm sorry to interrupt, but whom are you talking to?

1948
01:15:23.376 --> 01:15:25.386
- I was talking to the camera. - I see. The camera.

1949
01:15:25.716 --> 01:15:27.246
- Do you have one, Lyn? - Is that your personal cameraman?

1950
01:15:27.786 --> 01:15:29.987
Are you shooting a commercial by yourself?

1951
01:15:31.017 --> 01:15:33.386
- Does g.o.d have winter songs? - Of course, they do.

1952
01:15:33.386 --> 01:15:35.397
Our songs give off the winter vibe.

1953
01:15:35.397 --> 01:15:38.527
- "I Love You and Remember". - You're right.

1954
01:15:38.527 --> 01:15:41.596
- But it's an old song. - Didn't you sing a song with Lyn?

1955
01:15:41.596 --> 01:15:42.636
- Yes. - There are many.

1956
01:15:42.636 --> 01:15:45.336
For these songs, whoever spots the song will go down first.

1957
01:15:45.336 --> 01:15:46.336
- They won't go down together? - We must go down first?

1958
01:15:46.336 --> 01:15:47.706
- No. - No? Whoever spots first will go?

1959
01:15:47.706 --> 01:15:48.706
Yes.

1960
01:15:49.937 --> 01:15:53.046
- You must say it's your song first. - That's right.

1961
01:15:53.046 --> 01:15:55.517
If this happens, they could force their way out of this.

1962
01:15:55.947 --> 01:15:57.017
They could force their way out of this.

1963
01:15:57.617 --> 01:15:58.617
I can't wait to do this today.

1964
01:15:58.947 --> 01:16:01.216
- That might be possible. - Even if that's the case,

1965
01:16:01.216 --> 01:16:02.756
the customers must recognize us. If not, it won't count.

1966
01:16:02.756 --> 01:16:04.756
- Okay. - Hey, stop it.

1967
01:16:04.756 --> 01:16:06.626
Stop mentioning that.

1968
01:16:06.626 --> 01:16:07.827
- Don't do that. - What's wrong with you?

1969
01:16:07.827 --> 01:16:09.256
- It's a trauma. - My gosh.

1970
01:16:09.256 --> 01:16:11.426
Let's check out the rooms now.

1971
01:16:11.426 --> 01:16:13.727
- Let's check out Room One. - See what kind of songs they sing.

1972
01:16:15.867 --> 01:16:18.166
("Marriage" by Moon Moon)

1973
01:16:18.607 --> 01:16:19.767
Let's check out Room Two.

1974
01:16:20.607 --> 01:16:24.536
("Yes" by Min Seo)

1975
01:16:24.536 --> 01:16:26.077
- It's "Yes". - "Yes".

1976
01:16:26.077 --> 01:16:27.647
- Please lower the volume. - That's Part Two of "Like It".

1977
01:16:27.846 --> 01:16:30.416
- Let's check out Room Three. - Her voice sounds quite young.

1978
01:16:30.416 --> 01:16:33.716
("Contrail" by Moon Moon)

1979
01:16:35.117 --> 01:16:37.187
- I don't know any of recent songs. - Lower the volume for now.

1980
01:16:37.187 --> 01:16:41.827
Since it's winter, the songs are...

1981
01:16:41.827 --> 01:16:44.327
- quite calm. - They sound heartwarming.

1982
01:16:44.327 --> 01:16:45.567
- We haven't... - I won't make it today.

1983
01:16:45.567 --> 01:16:47.096
- We are in Yeoksam, - Right.

1984
01:16:47.096 --> 01:16:50.596
but the songs sung in here are about the same with songs sung in Hongdae.

1985
01:16:50.596 --> 01:16:52.907
In order to find out what kind of songs are often sung in karaoke,

1986
01:16:52.907 --> 01:16:54.966
we will check out the rankings of favorite songs in karaoke.

1987
01:16:54.966 --> 01:16:57.107
- To win, the songs must be on this. - Right.

1988
01:16:57.107 --> 01:16:59.846
Actually, a lot of people look at rankings to choose the song.

1989
01:16:59.846 --> 01:17:01.277
- Right. - Now...

1990
01:17:01.277 --> 01:17:02.777
we're going to announce the favorite song ranking.

1991
01:17:02.777 --> 01:17:04.676
If your song is on the list,

1992
01:17:04.676 --> 01:17:06.687
- we'll play the highlight part... - Right.

1993
01:17:06.687 --> 01:17:09.517
like music shows for a short period.

1994
01:17:09.617 --> 01:17:10.916
Here we go.

1995
01:17:10.916 --> 01:17:13.227
It's the karaoke ranking. "Integrated Songs".

1996
01:17:13.227 --> 01:17:14.857
- 25th. - There really is one.

1997
01:17:14.857 --> 01:17:17.397
Lee Seok Hoon and others. "Because It's Christmas".

1998
01:17:17.397 --> 01:17:18.466
Others.

1999
01:17:18.796 --> 01:17:20.126
Today

2000
01:17:20.126 --> 01:17:21.796
You're late.

2001
01:17:22.666 --> 01:17:23.697
(Okay)

2002
01:17:23.966 --> 01:17:25.666
- You don't need to do that. - You were two tempos late.

2003
01:17:25.666 --> 01:17:27.407
- You need to do it right away. - He even forces himself to sing.

2004
01:17:29.006 --> 01:17:30.006
He's weird.

2005
01:17:30.006 --> 01:17:31.006
(It's fun to make fun of Seok Hoon.)

2006
01:17:31.006 --> 01:17:32.147
- Don't do that. - Now...

2007
01:17:32.147 --> 01:17:33.477
- It's fine. - cheer up, Seok Hoon.

2008
01:17:33.477 --> 01:17:35.716
It's fine. We can do this.

2009
01:17:35.716 --> 01:17:37.517
- "Integrated Songs". - It's pretty harsh here.

2010
01:17:37.577 --> 01:17:39.987
- Sing on the right timing. - On 25th. Lee Seok Hoon and others.

2011
01:17:39.987 --> 01:17:41.286
"Because It's Christmas".

2012
01:17:42.687 --> 01:17:44.817
(His voice is sweet like honey.)

2013
01:17:44.817 --> 01:17:48.657
Will my heart be expressed to you

2014
01:17:48.657 --> 01:17:50.996
It's 102nd. Kim Tae Woo's "Love Rain".

2015
01:17:50.996 --> 01:17:54.166
If my love comes into your head

2016
01:17:54.166 --> 01:17:55.237
Not that part.

2017
01:17:55.237 --> 01:17:56.636
Rain of love will come down

2018
01:17:57.096 --> 01:17:58.136
(The climax)

2019
01:17:58.136 --> 01:17:59.166
Yes. That part.

2020
01:17:59.166 --> 01:18:01.307
It's 129th. Lyn's "Back in Time".

2021
01:18:01.836 --> 01:18:03.977
(Sweet and ardent)

2022
01:18:05.577 --> 01:18:06.607
(Chuckling)

2023
01:18:06.607 --> 01:18:09.117
("Forbidden Love" by Kim Kyung Ho)

2024
01:18:09.277 --> 01:18:11.786
- It's 193rd. Kim Kyung Ho's... - It's on 193rd.

2025
01:18:11.786 --> 01:18:13.817
- "Forbidden Love". - He barely made it.

2026
01:18:14.187 --> 01:18:15.956
You seriously call this a ranking?

2027
01:18:17.617 --> 01:18:19.227
(They're wiped out.)

2028
01:18:19.227 --> 01:18:20.557
You have to sing.

2029
01:18:20.657 --> 01:18:23.796
Why would you get upset? You have to sing.

2030
01:18:23.796 --> 01:18:24.857
You need to sing.

2031
01:18:24.857 --> 01:18:26.496
You said I barely manage to live...

2032
01:18:26.496 --> 01:18:29.596
on Kwon Hyeok Soo. You're doing it again.

2033
01:18:29.836 --> 01:18:31.767
You have to sing.

2034
01:18:31.767 --> 01:18:34.006
- Calm down. - You have to sing.

2035
01:18:34.937 --> 01:18:36.706
"You call this a ranking."

2036
01:18:37.206 --> 01:18:38.977
193rd isn't a ranking.

2037
01:18:38.977 --> 01:18:41.376
I didn't pronounce it right on purpose.

2038
01:18:41.376 --> 01:18:42.447
(It's just a ranking. Happy Together loves Kim Kyung Ho.)

2039
01:18:42.447 --> 01:18:43.817
- Let's go back to 16th. - Be generous.

2040
01:18:43.817 --> 01:18:45.916
- It's OST area. 16th. - It's OST.

2041
01:18:45.916 --> 01:18:47.386
Lyn's "Back in Time".

2042
01:18:47.386 --> 01:18:49.456
Back in Time

2043
01:18:49.456 --> 01:18:51.557
- Is that the only song I have? - Yes.

2044
01:18:51.657 --> 01:18:53.256
- Can I step back - She keeps singing the same song.

2045
01:18:53.256 --> 01:18:55.157
- She keeps singing the same song. - Hold on.

2046
01:18:55.157 --> 01:18:57.426
Lyn. Kyung Ho's ranking is 193rd.

2047
01:18:57.456 --> 01:18:59.727
I just calmed him down.

2048
01:18:59.796 --> 01:19:01.166
Give him a break.

2049
01:19:01.166 --> 01:19:03.096
- You're... - Hey. You're on 16th.

2050
01:19:03.096 --> 01:19:04.737
on 16th.

2051
01:19:04.767 --> 01:19:07.937
It's 16th on the list. "Back in Time" by Lyn.

2052
01:19:07.937 --> 01:19:11.036
- Back in Time - It's a good song.

2053
01:19:11.036 --> 01:19:12.077
(She sings in a passionate tone.)

2054
01:19:12.447 --> 01:19:14.706
It's 41st on the list. "By My Side" by SG Wannabe.

It's on 61st. "Confession" by Lee Seok Hoon.

2057

("Confession")

2058
01:19:23.956 --> 01:19:25.886
(He can't remember.)

2059
01:19:25.886 --> 01:19:26.956
- He doesn't know. - He doesn't know.

2060
01:19:26.956 --> 01:19:28.327
- What? - It's his own song.

2061
01:19:28.327 --> 01:19:30.027
- It's your song. - How can he not know his song?

2062
01:19:30.027 --> 01:19:31.027
How can you not remember "Confession"?

2063
01:19:31.027 --> 01:19:32.626
It's because he has too many songs.

2064
01:19:32.727 --> 01:19:35.237
It's 82nd. "You and I" by Lee Seok Hoon.

2065
01:19:35.237 --> 01:19:36.237
("You and I")

2066
01:19:36.237 --> 01:19:38.237
- Come on. - What are you doing?

2067
01:19:38.237 --> 01:19:39.767
(What are you doing?)

2068
01:19:39.937 --> 01:19:42.006
- How can you not know your song? - That's why...

2069
01:19:42.006 --> 01:19:44.036
Stop yelling at me.

2070
01:19:44.336 --> 01:19:46.376
- It's hard to remember. - Gosh.

2071
01:19:46.376 --> 01:19:48.517
It's over. Let's skip it.

2072
01:19:48.546 --> 01:19:49.876
- Next. - Let's check ballad.

2073
01:19:49.876 --> 01:19:51.546
- Many of his songs were on OST. - It's the ballad section.

2074
01:19:51.647 --> 01:19:53.416
- You're on a roll. - It's "Because It's Christmas"...

2075
01:19:53.416 --> 01:19:54.987
- by Lee Seok Hoon. - He's on a roll.

2076
01:19:54.987 --> 01:19:57.117
Is today okay

2077
01:19:57.117 --> 01:19:58.157
It's this one again?

2078
01:19:58.157 --> 01:20:01.227
It's 74th on the list. "Back in Time" by Lyn.

2079
01:20:01.626 --> 01:20:04.227
- It bugs me. - Come on.

2080
01:20:04.596 --> 01:20:06.126
(I have many songs.)

2081
01:20:06.126 --> 01:20:07.867
- Just stay out of the list like me. - Why do you only have this one?

2082
01:20:07.867 --> 01:20:10.267
I think I'm worse than Kyung Ho.

2083
01:20:10.267 --> 01:20:11.296
Just stay out of the list.

2084
01:20:11.296 --> 01:20:14.166
It's 120th. "10 Reasons to Love You" by Lee Seok Hoon.

2085
01:20:14.807 --> 01:20:16.607
(It helped him go home third.)

2086
01:20:16.607 --> 01:20:18.447
It helped him go home.

2087
01:20:18.447 --> 01:20:20.706
140th. "By My Side" by SG Wannabe.

2088
01:20:20.706 --> 01:20:22.346
(Seok Hoon's solo stage)

2089
01:20:22.346 --> 01:20:24.246
- Good. - 180th. "Lalala" by SG Wannabe.

2090
01:20:24.246 --> 01:20:26.017
Everyone. Sing.

2091
01:20:26.017 --> 01:20:27.916
(Lalala together)

2092
01:20:27.916 --> 01:20:30.416
- Good. - I'm not in the mood to sing.

2093
01:20:30.416 --> 01:20:32.657
65th. "One Candle" by g.o.d.

("Love Rain" MR)

2097
01:20:40.697 --> 01:20:42.336
- Instrumental. - MR.

2098
01:20:42.336 --> 01:20:43.466
- But... - That's funny.

2099
01:20:43.466 --> 01:20:44.897
- what's... - That's hilarious.

2100
01:20:44.897 --> 01:20:46.407
- important here is... - That's so funny.

2101
01:20:46.506 --> 01:20:49.737
that even MR is higher than Kyung Ho's ranking.

2102
01:20:50.777 --> 01:20:52.947
- MR is. - MR is higher.

2103
01:20:52.947 --> 01:20:53.977
MR is higher.

2104
01:20:54.876 --> 01:20:57.676
- MR. - It's not a song.

2105
01:20:58.176 --> 01:20:59.487
Did you get the right ranking?

2106
01:21:00.117 --> 01:21:01.546
It really exists.

2107
01:21:01.546 --> 01:21:03.987
- It's finally Rhythm and Blues. - Rhythm and Blues.

2108
01:21:03.987 --> 01:21:05.357
Great.

2109
01:21:05.357 --> 01:21:08.027
31st. "We Were in Love" by Lyn. It's a new song.

2110
01:21:08.027 --> 01:21:09.756
Please don't do that

2111
01:21:09.756 --> 01:21:11.557
(She's excited.)

2112
01:21:11.557 --> 01:21:14.666
SG Wannabe's on 31st. "Must Have Love".

2113
01:21:14.666 --> 01:21:17.166
(Seok Hoon's busy.)

2114
01:21:17.367 --> 01:21:19.536
- I know this song. - It was popular.

2115
01:21:19.536 --> 01:21:21.536
34th. "As I Live" by SG Wannabe

2116
01:21:21.836 --> 01:21:24.536
(He pretty much seized the chart.)

2117
01:21:24.607 --> 01:21:26.607
It's 55th. "Timeless" by SG Wannabe.

2118
01:21:26.947 --> 01:21:31.176
I cannot forget you, but I want to hold you

2119
01:21:31.176 --> 01:21:33.546
- "Teddy Bear" by Lyn on 64th. - You sang everything.

2120
01:21:33.546 --> 01:21:35.916
I erased the red heart

2121
01:21:35.916 --> 01:21:37.756
"Partner for Life" by SG Wannabe on 90th.

2122
01:21:37.756 --> 01:21:39.557
(It's Seok Hoon again.)

2123
01:21:39.557 --> 01:21:41.187
- Great. - Great.

2124
01:21:41.187 --> 01:21:43.157
"Sin and Punishment" by SG Wannabe on 120th.

2125
01:21:43.756 --> 01:21:45.466
(He looks anxious.)

2126
01:21:45.466 --> 01:21:47.126
I can't remember this.

2127
01:21:47.126 --> 01:21:48.767
(I can't remember this.)

2128
01:21:49.197 --> 01:21:50.367
It's your song.

2129
01:21:51.036 --> 01:21:53.536
It's not easy to remember the song when you suddenly make them sing it.

2130
01:21:53.536 --> 01:21:55.107
- Right. - Back then...

2131
01:21:55.107 --> 01:21:56.506
I'm sorry, but did you sing?

2132
01:21:56.506 --> 01:21:58.447
I'm relaxing. It's out of the list.

2133
01:21:58.447 --> 01:22:00.006
"We Were in Love" by Lyn.

2134
01:22:00.846 --> 01:22:03.916
(He's been silent enough for his breath to smell.)

2135
01:22:04.647 --> 01:22:06.286
(Not even one is on the list.)

2136
01:22:06.647 --> 01:22:08.017
- There's none. - No.

2137
01:22:08.017 --> 01:22:10.286
I'm sure they changed it on purpose.

2138
01:22:10.517 --> 01:22:12.687
I told you to do your job properly.

2139
01:22:13.527 --> 01:22:15.057
(Awesome)

2140
01:22:16.897 --> 01:22:18.367
Why would you go by genre?

2141
01:22:18.867 --> 01:22:19.926
I only sing rock.

2142
01:22:20.626 --> 01:22:23.036
- Sit down. - It's fine.

2143
01:22:23.036 --> 01:22:25.107
- Is there going to be rock? - It's strange to be in this chart.

2144
01:22:25.107 --> 01:22:26.367
- There will be rock later. - There is.

2145
01:22:26.367 --> 01:22:28.206
It'd be weird to be in the Rhythm and Blues chart.

2146
01:22:28.206 --> 01:22:29.277
It's weird to be on the list now.

2147
01:22:29.277 --> 01:22:30.506
It's weird for your song to be on this list.

2148
01:22:30.506 --> 01:22:33.246
"Love It's All Lies" by Lyn on 163rd.

2149
01:22:33.246 --> 01:22:34.246
It's a good song.

2150
01:22:34.246 --> 01:22:36.517
Love What on earth is it

2151
01:22:36.517 --> 01:22:38.647
- Next up is adult. - Adult.

2152
01:22:39.716 --> 01:22:41.017
(Adult songs)

2153
01:22:41.786 --> 01:22:43.456
You're on adult song list.

2154
01:22:44.216 --> 01:22:45.687
(Amazing)

2155
01:22:45.956 --> 01:22:47.626
- Finally. - But...

2156
01:22:47.886 --> 01:22:49.626
it's on 24th of the list on adult songs.

2157
01:22:49.626 --> 01:22:51.057
"Forbidden Love" by Kim Kyung Ho.

2158
01:22:51.057 --> 01:22:53.966
My song's an adult song?

2159
01:22:54.796 --> 01:22:56.296
- Right. - Seriously.

2160
01:22:56.296 --> 01:22:58.136
Is this supposed to comfort me?

2161
01:22:58.136 --> 01:22:59.567
- Please sing. - Stop it.

2162
01:22:59.567 --> 01:23:01.506
- "Forbidden Love". - Hurry up and sing.

2163
01:23:01.506 --> 01:23:04.036
- "Forbidden Love" by Kim Kyung Ho. - We're all adults.

2164
01:23:04.206 --> 01:23:05.407
You're on 24th of the list.

2165
01:23:05.407 --> 01:23:06.907
I love you

2166
01:23:06.907 --> 01:23:08.046
(Kim Kyung Ho is great as expected.)

2167
01:23:08.046 --> 01:23:09.977
"People Who Make Me Sad" by Kim Kyung Ho on 87th.

2168
01:23:09.977 --> 01:23:11.886
Why are they all in the adult chart?

2169
01:23:13.916 --> 01:23:15.586
(He complains, but he still sings.)

2170
01:23:15.586 --> 01:23:17.657
"Heartless" by Kim Kyung Ho on 125th.

2171
01:23:17.657 --> 01:23:19.756
How

2172
01:23:19.756 --> 01:23:21.727
- "One Candle" by g.o.d on 155th. - "One Candle".

2173
01:23:21.727 --> 01:23:24.657
I'll hold your hand

2174
01:23:25.027 --> 01:23:26.067
(They finish warmly.)

2175
01:23:26.067 --> 01:23:28.126
I'll hold your hand. Let's hold hands.

2176
01:23:28.126 --> 01:23:30.966
The adult song here doesn't mean...

2177
01:23:30.966 --> 01:23:32.937
- anything erotic, - What is it?

2178
01:23:33.166 --> 01:23:35.506
but it's office workers in their 30s and 40s.

2179
01:23:35.506 --> 01:23:37.876
Then you should call it office workers.

2180
01:23:37.876 --> 01:23:39.977
Anyway, that's what it says in karaoke.

2181
01:23:39.977 --> 01:23:42.876
You should call it office workers in 30s and 40s.

2182
01:23:42.876 --> 01:23:43.977
- No. - It's an adult chart.

2183
01:23:43.977 --> 01:23:46.246
- That's what it says here. - It's an adult chart.

2184
01:23:46.246 --> 01:23:48.857
He's starting to be sensitive again.

2185
01:23:48.916 --> 01:23:50.456
I'm getting nervous.

2186
01:23:50.456 --> 01:23:51.786
- What surprised me was that... - Something like...

2187
01:23:51.786 --> 01:23:53.227
"At the Andong Station" should be on that list.

2188
01:23:53.227 --> 01:23:54.256
- No. - What?

2189
01:23:55.527 --> 01:23:57.126
What are you doing?

2190
01:23:57.126 --> 01:23:58.567
- What? It's over? - It's over?

2191
01:23:58.567 --> 01:23:59.596
What about rock ballad?

2192
01:24:00.096 --> 01:24:01.567
- There isn't one. - Then you should've had a survey.

2193
01:24:01.567 --> 01:24:03.596
There's Rhythm and Blues, but why don't they survey rock?

2194
01:24:03.596 --> 01:24:05.136
Rock ballad isn't on the chart.

2195
01:24:05.237 --> 01:24:07.036
Does the adult chart include rock?

2196
01:24:07.036 --> 01:24:08.807
It's hard to sing rock in Korea.

2197
01:24:10.636 --> 01:24:12.546
(Agony of a rocker)

2198
01:24:14.246 --> 01:24:15.746
(We respect you.)

2199
01:24:16.746 --> 01:24:19.647
- That's mean. - He's complaining a lot as usual.

2200
01:24:19.647 --> 01:24:22.317
- Lyn and Kyung Ho... - I'm ruined.

2201
01:24:22.317 --> 01:24:24.687
are complaining...

2202
01:24:24.687 --> 01:24:25.886
the most.

2203
01:24:25.886 --> 01:24:28.187
- Seok Hoon of SG Wannabe... - They're singing my song.

2204
01:24:28.187 --> 01:24:29.197
Really?

2205
01:24:29.197 --> 01:24:30.796
- Where? - It's true.

2206
01:24:30.796 --> 01:24:32.296
(They're envious.)

2207
01:24:33.327 --> 01:24:34.796
(They're entering the number.)

2208
01:24:35.166 --> 01:24:37.836
("Back in Time" by Lyn)

2209
01:24:37.836 --> 01:24:39.737
She's always the first one to leave.

2210
01:24:39.737 --> 01:24:41.407
We haven't started yet.

2211
01:24:41.407 --> 01:24:44.006
- You can leave only when we begin. - Didn't this happen last time?

2212
01:24:44.506 --> 01:24:46.176
This happened last time too. I'm worried.

2213
01:24:46.176 --> 01:24:47.876
- Did it happen last time? - Yes.

2214
01:24:47.876 --> 01:24:48.947
I have a good feeling.

2215
01:24:48.947 --> 01:24:50.617
We haven't started yet.

2216
01:24:50.617 --> 01:24:53.286
If we did, she'd get to leave now.

2217
01:24:53.286 --> 01:24:54.416
- Right. - I know.

2218
01:24:54.416 --> 01:24:56.716
Soo Yong might get to leave early.

2219
01:24:57.456 --> 01:24:59.756
- You can't really say that. - Okay.

2220
01:24:59.756 --> 01:25:01.657
- I have good news. - What is it?

2221
01:25:01.657 --> 01:25:03.426
Aside from the last time,

2222
01:25:03.426 --> 01:25:05.126
his new song made a hit.

2223
01:25:05.126 --> 01:25:06.227
- "Go Back Couple". - Right.

2224
01:25:06.227 --> 01:25:09.397
He sang the title song of "Go Back Couple".

2225
01:25:09.397 --> 01:25:10.937
That's a great news.

2226
01:25:10.937 --> 01:25:13.336
It plays when Son Ho Jun...

2227
01:25:13.336 --> 01:25:15.536
- becomes sad in the drama. - Yes.

2228
01:25:15.536 --> 01:25:17.937
- It plays in the sad part. - Okay.

2229
01:25:18.077 --> 01:25:20.206
- The weird thing is... - What is that?

2230
01:25:20.206 --> 01:25:23.617
in case of Lyn, her song plays throughout the drama,

2231
01:25:23.617 --> 01:25:26.416
but songs I sang or SG Wannabe sang...

2232
01:25:26.416 --> 01:25:27.987
- are barely played. - Why?

2233
01:25:27.987 --> 01:25:30.456
They should play it if it's for the drama.

2234
01:25:30.586 --> 01:25:32.187
- Why? - They don't play it. I don't know.

2235
01:25:32.187 --> 01:25:34.426
- There are not that many sad parts. - I see.

2236
01:25:34.426 --> 01:25:36.357
- I know the reason. - What is it?

2237
01:25:36.357 --> 01:25:38.666
I sang many OST songs, but you barely hear them.

2238
01:25:38.666 --> 01:25:40.527
- Why not? - Because...

2239
01:25:40.527 --> 01:25:44.367
SG Wannabe and I have powerful voices.

2240
01:25:44.367 --> 01:25:46.206
Those songs aren't played often.

2241
01:25:46.407 --> 01:25:49.107
Only the songs that are soft like Lyn's...

2242
01:25:49.107 --> 01:25:51.176
are played to help the mood.

2243
01:25:51.176 --> 01:25:53.447
- Songs that help you focus. - Yes.

2244
01:25:53.447 --> 01:25:54.447
Because it doesn't help you focus on the drama.

2245
01:25:54.447 --> 01:25:56.117
I had so many complaints too.

2246
01:25:56.817 --> 01:25:58.017
How about you, Kyung Ho?

2247
01:25:58.017 --> 01:26:01.317
People think I wouldn't sing OST because I'm a rocker,

2248
01:26:01.317 --> 01:26:02.956
but I did sing OST.

2249
01:26:02.956 --> 01:26:04.216
- Really? - I sang the title song.

2250
01:26:04.216 --> 01:26:06.227
It was for "Human Market".

2251
01:26:06.527 --> 01:26:08.857
It was 4 or 5 years ago. It's pretty recent.

2252
01:26:08.857 --> 01:26:10.857
I think historical drama OST would suit you.

2253
01:26:10.857 --> 01:26:11.926
But that's...

2254
01:26:12.067 --> 01:26:13.126
(Singing)

2255
01:26:13.867 --> 01:26:14.897
(That's actually not bad.)

2256
01:26:14.897 --> 01:26:16.897
- Unlike you think... - Stop it now.

2257
01:26:17.036 --> 01:26:18.036
I don't sing like that.

2258
01:26:18.036 --> 01:26:19.506
It hurts

2259
01:26:20.006 --> 01:26:24.006
("It Hurts" by Kim Kyung Ho)

2260
01:26:24.737 --> 01:26:26.046
- He'd be good at it. - For that part.

2261
01:26:26.046 --> 01:26:27.676
- That's right. - Right.

2262
01:26:28.517 --> 01:26:32.216
Last time you were here, we analyzed the big data.

2263
01:26:32.216 --> 01:26:36.017
After the show, we updated it.

2264
01:26:36.017 --> 01:26:37.657
We've got a new big data analysis.

2265
01:26:37.657 --> 01:26:39.286
- I'm looking forward to it. - Yes.

2266
01:26:39.286 --> 01:26:41.586
Big data analysis of Sing My Song guests.

2267
01:26:41.586 --> 01:26:42.897
I'll make it brief.

2268
01:26:42.897 --> 01:26:44.057
It's Kim Kyung Ho.

2269
01:26:44.426 --> 01:26:47.296
After he was on Happy Together Sing My Song,

2270
01:26:47.296 --> 01:26:49.666
people in 20s recognize him,

2271
01:26:49.666 --> 01:26:52.607
but people in 40s still recognize him more.

2272
01:26:52.607 --> 01:26:54.367
That word "still".

2273
01:26:54.636 --> 01:26:56.937
You keep adding it to a compliment.

2274
01:26:57.036 --> 01:26:58.777
- All right. - Don't be bothered by it.

2275
01:26:58.777 --> 01:27:00.346
- Okay. - It means you're consistent.

2276
01:27:00.346 --> 01:27:02.676
Look at the sense of the overall sentence.

2277
01:27:02.676 --> 01:27:04.987
- You should say steadily. - I know.

2278
01:27:04.987 --> 01:27:08.286
It's discovered that some people became a fan...

2279
01:27:08.286 --> 01:27:10.716
after seeing his coy look.

2280
01:27:11.086 --> 01:27:13.857
It seems women's interest has risen...

2281
01:27:13.857 --> 01:27:15.956
compare to men's interest in the past.

2282
01:27:15.956 --> 01:27:17.697
- It's risen. - Yes.

2283
01:27:17.956 --> 01:27:22.237
It's women's second preference in songs after Lyn.

2284
01:27:22.237 --> 01:27:24.966
(Positive big data)

2285
01:27:24.966 --> 01:27:26.937
- 2nd among these 4 people? - Yes.

2286
01:27:26.937 --> 01:27:30.376
He didn't place second in overall genres.

2287
01:27:30.607 --> 01:27:32.407
- 2nd among 4 people here. - 2nd.

2288
01:27:32.407 --> 01:27:33.706
- That's still good. - Right.

2289
01:27:33.706 --> 01:27:34.706
It's Lyn now.

2290
01:27:35.077 --> 01:27:38.947
They've received many news that many people sang her songs.

2291
01:27:39.086 --> 01:27:42.487
Many people were sad that she became the last singer.

2292
01:27:42.716 --> 01:27:45.987
Her songs are steadily selected as women's favorite songs in karaoke.

2293
01:27:45.987 --> 01:27:49.897
People complimented on her high quality voice and singing ability.

2294
01:27:49.897 --> 01:27:51.897
I like that compliment.

2295
01:27:51.897 --> 01:27:56.096
Apparently, Lyn laughed a lot watching Kyung Ho on the show.

2296
01:27:56.096 --> 01:27:57.697
I didn't laugh at him.

2297
01:27:58.166 --> 01:28:01.636
- She knows me well. - Yes. I know him well.

2298
01:28:01.876 --> 01:28:04.506
Also, he's a big senior.

2299
01:28:04.506 --> 01:28:06.046
- He's not like that normally. - Right.

2300
01:28:06.046 --> 01:28:08.876
- He's actually very generous. - He's warmhearted.

2301
01:28:09.346 --> 01:28:12.317
I didn't understand it until I got here.

2302
01:28:12.317 --> 01:28:13.487
- Right. - That happens.

2303
01:28:13.487 --> 01:28:16.086
It's actually worse. I was actually holding my tears back.

2304
01:28:16.086 --> 01:28:17.487
- Really? - I was very upset.

2305
01:28:17.487 --> 01:28:19.057
- He probably... - When you placed the last?

2306
01:28:19.057 --> 01:28:21.227
The moment Seok Hoon left?

2307
01:28:21.487 --> 01:28:23.397
- Is that when you started crying? - Why would you bring me up?

2308
01:28:23.397 --> 01:28:26.426
I was upset when there were only two of us left.

2309
01:28:27.067 --> 01:28:29.096
- From that moment. - Yes. Why am I here with him?

2310
01:28:29.096 --> 01:28:31.166
"Why am I sitting here with Seok Hoon?"

2311
01:28:31.166 --> 01:28:34.036
He's so much younger than me.

2312
01:28:34.567 --> 01:28:37.206
- "So much younger." - What am I doing here with him?

2313
01:28:37.206 --> 01:28:39.577
Are you normally moody?

2314
01:28:39.577 --> 01:28:41.716
Thank you for taking care of me.

2315
01:28:41.716 --> 01:28:43.977
(Thank you for taking care of my footage amount.)

2316
01:28:44.577 --> 01:28:46.886
No one expected it.

2317
01:28:46.886 --> 01:28:48.246
Hold on.

2318
01:28:48.246 --> 01:28:50.817
It looks like he's wearing a doctor's gown.

2319
01:28:51.416 --> 01:28:53.327
- A psychiatrist. - He does.

2320
01:28:53.857 --> 01:28:55.626
He looks like he's going to do a psychiatric evaluation.

2321
01:28:55.626 --> 01:28:58.096
Why would you check her knee when you're a psychiatrist?

2322
01:28:58.096 --> 01:29:00.197
- Seriously. - "Moody."

2323
01:29:00.197 --> 01:29:02.996
I guess I'm normally moody,

2324
01:29:02.996 --> 01:29:04.666
so when my friends call me,

2325
01:29:04.666 --> 01:29:07.867
they called me where should I dance to.

2326
01:29:07.867 --> 01:29:09.577
- Which tune... - They didn't know what to do.

2327
01:29:09.577 --> 01:29:11.536
- That's what they called me. - You had emotional ups and downs.

2328
01:29:11.536 --> 01:29:13.077
- Is that what they called you? - Yes.

2329
01:29:13.077 --> 01:29:17.846
When they said they don't know what to do with me,

2330
01:29:17.846 --> 01:29:22.317
I didn't get it. I always try to be considerate.

2331
01:29:22.687 --> 01:29:25.157
I didn't understand why they'd say that,

2332
01:29:25.157 --> 01:29:27.126
but after watching Happy Together,

2333
01:29:27.227 --> 01:29:30.956
- You realized. - I figured it out.

2334
01:29:30.956 --> 01:29:32.897
Tae Woo knows her well. They're pretty close.

2335
01:29:32.897 --> 01:29:34.527
- How is she? - How is she?

2336
01:29:34.897 --> 01:29:37.296
When we have drinks together,

2337
01:29:37.496 --> 01:29:40.237
she'd say something funny, and we'd laugh.

2338
01:29:40.237 --> 01:29:42.407
Then she'd say, "Is that funny?"

2339
01:29:43.977 --> 01:29:45.846
- While laughing together? - Goodness.

2340
01:29:45.846 --> 01:29:47.346
She was like that in her 20s.

2341
01:29:47.346 --> 01:29:48.716
That's when I was in 20s.

2342
01:29:48.716 --> 01:29:49.777
- And... - Actually,

2343
01:29:50.617 --> 01:29:54.286
she's one of few women who yell at me.

2344
01:29:54.447 --> 01:29:55.617
- Really? - Yes.

2345
01:29:55.617 --> 01:29:57.857
I think she yells at me more than my wife.

2346
01:29:57.857 --> 01:29:59.357
- Really? - That's not true.

2347
01:29:59.487 --> 01:30:01.996
Do you agree with her nickname?

2348
01:30:01.996 --> 01:30:04.527
Yes. She's pretty moody sometimes.

2349
01:30:04.956 --> 01:30:06.367
- It's Tae Woo now. - Yes.

2350
01:30:06.367 --> 01:30:08.897
Regardless of gender and age, people showed...

2351
01:30:08.897 --> 01:30:11.367
high interest and positive reactions since he's a national idol.

2352
01:30:11.367 --> 01:30:14.267
Also, people change the lyrics of "Love Rain" on social media to...

2353
01:30:14.267 --> 01:30:17.607
make a song called "Cost-effective Rain" to expose a cheap boyfriend.

2354
01:30:17.607 --> 01:30:18.676
("Cost-effective Rain" is popular which exposes a cheap boyfriend.)

2355
01:30:18.676 --> 01:30:22.077
- Cost-effective rain comes down - "Cost-effective."

2356
01:30:22.077 --> 01:30:23.077
That's unbelievable.

2357
01:30:23.077 --> 01:30:24.447
- Did you know this? - Many people ask him...

2358
01:30:24.447 --> 01:30:27.147
to sing "Cost-effective Rain".

2359
01:30:27.147 --> 01:30:28.857
- Can you sing it please? - Cost-effective rain comes down

2360
01:30:29.286 --> 01:30:30.687
- With that lyric? - Yes.

2361
01:30:30.687 --> 01:30:32.426
- "Cost-effective rain comes down" - Go easy.

2362
01:30:32.657 --> 01:30:35.796
(Cost-effective)

2363
01:30:36.256 --> 01:30:37.357
(It lingers in their mouth.)

2364
01:30:37.357 --> 01:30:38.496
It's perfect.

2365
01:30:38.496 --> 01:30:41.697
Now, it's Seok Hoon's turn after he was on Happy Together.

2366
01:30:41.697 --> 01:30:44.367
- I can't wait. - People are complimenting on...

2367
01:30:44.466 --> 01:30:46.067
his sweet and stable voice and that he's cute.

2368
01:30:46.607 --> 01:30:48.876
SG Wannabe's songs are still popular among men...

2369
01:30:48.876 --> 01:30:51.206
rather than Seok Hoon's solo songs.

2370
01:30:51.206 --> 01:30:53.307
Did you have to add that word there?

2371
01:30:53.307 --> 01:30:56.577
Yes. It's necessary. After the show,

2372
01:30:56.577 --> 01:30:59.947
people think they sang his song after realizing it's Happy Together.

2373
01:31:00.147 --> 01:31:02.416
They've found people doubting.

2374
01:31:02.617 --> 01:31:04.886
- "Doubting." - People realized it...

2375
01:31:04.886 --> 01:31:07.357
- and decided to sing it for him. - They realized it.

2376
01:31:07.357 --> 01:31:10.596
By the way, are you preparing for a musical?

2377
01:31:10.596 --> 01:31:13.227
- Goodness. - Yes. I'm preparing a musical.

2378
01:31:13.227 --> 01:31:14.466
What's the title?

2379
01:31:14.466 --> 01:31:16.567
It's called "Kinky Boots".

2380
01:31:16.567 --> 01:31:19.067
- That's really famous. - Right.

2381
01:31:19.067 --> 01:31:20.966
It was also on Broadway.

2382
01:31:20.966 --> 01:31:22.937
- Are you the main character? - Yes.

2383
01:31:23.277 --> 01:31:24.277
(That's wonderful.)

2384
01:31:25.307 --> 01:31:27.107
When does it start?

2385
01:31:27.307 --> 01:31:29.077
From end of January to early April.

2386
01:31:29.077 --> 01:31:31.886
- You must be busy practicing. - Yes. I keep practicing.

2387
01:31:31.886 --> 01:31:34.046
- Actually... - By the way,

2388
01:31:34.046 --> 01:31:36.617
he's got many good news after he was on Happy Together.

2389
01:31:37.317 --> 01:31:39.256
I don't think it's because of this show.

2390
01:31:39.456 --> 01:31:41.487
- Anyway, - But...

2391
01:31:41.487 --> 01:31:42.697
it's after this show.

2392
01:31:42.697 --> 01:31:43.926
- There are many bad news. - No.

2393
01:31:43.926 --> 01:31:46.466
They said I was forceful. That hurt me.

2394
01:31:46.466 --> 01:31:49.237
Anyway, you've gotten many good news after Happy Together.

2395
01:31:49.237 --> 01:31:51.767
- It's great. - Actually after this show,

2396
01:31:51.767 --> 01:31:54.607
- I've become mentally strong. - That's what's important.

2397
01:31:54.607 --> 01:31:57.876
- I was so nervous at first. - Okay.

2398
01:31:57.876 --> 01:32:00.607
- But I've become strong now. - Okay.

2399
01:32:00.607 --> 01:32:02.416
- You have to be strong. - I'm not nervous anymore.

2400
01:32:02.416 --> 01:32:05.317
It's like a training camp for singers.

2401
01:32:05.317 --> 01:32:07.586
The show's great when you do it with pride.

2402
01:32:07.586 --> 01:32:10.057
See? He's doing great right now.

2403
01:32:10.057 --> 01:32:12.187
- Look at him. - He only has malice.

2404
01:32:12.187 --> 01:32:15.996
He received good responses after getting upset and annoyed.

2405
01:32:15.996 --> 01:32:18.966
It's good that I'm on a roll, but I'd like to talk about the musical.

2406
01:32:18.966 --> 01:32:21.197
- Oh, about the musical. - Yes. I have a mission.

2407
01:32:21.197 --> 01:32:23.466
I'd like to stop talking about the musical.

2408
01:32:24.567 --> 01:32:26.636
Can I force to talk about it one more time?

2409
01:32:26.867 --> 01:32:29.876
- Let's stop. - Now...

2410
01:32:30.036 --> 01:32:31.977
- Yes? - it's 6pm.

2411
01:32:31.977 --> 01:32:35.447
- It's finally the rush hour. - Yes.

2412
01:32:35.577 --> 01:32:38.077
- People are finally off work. - That's right.

2413
01:32:38.077 --> 01:32:40.447
We haven't started yet,

2414
01:32:40.447 --> 01:32:42.617
but one of Lyn's songs was played.

2415
01:32:42.617 --> 01:32:43.786
Let's check the situation.

2416
01:32:45.586 --> 01:32:46.886
- "Nice to Meet You". - Yes.

2417
01:32:46.886 --> 01:32:47.987
(The prelude sounds familiar.)

2418
01:32:47.987 --> 01:32:50.057
- It's a pretty old song. - Hello

2419
01:32:50.057 --> 01:32:51.727
- This is old. - It's the "Hello" one.

2420
01:32:51.727 --> 01:32:53.466
- Put it down please. - It's from my generation.

2421
01:32:53.466 --> 01:32:55.466
- It's an old song. - We have a chance in Room Two.

2422
01:32:55.466 --> 01:32:56.867
Let's move to Room Three.

2423
01:32:58.267 --> 01:33:01.067
(Dancing)

2424
01:33:01.777 --> 01:33:03.937
- What's this song? - That's my song.

2425
01:33:04.977 --> 01:33:06.307
- Christmas song? - It's Seok Hoon's song.

2426
01:33:06.676 --> 01:33:08.846
- Hold on. - Is that the one?

2427
01:33:08.846 --> 01:33:11.647
I didn't sing it. Young Joon did.

2428
01:33:11.947 --> 01:33:12.947
Put it down.

2429
01:33:12.947 --> 01:33:16.857
It looks like Seok Hoon has a high chance today.

2430
01:33:16.886 --> 01:33:18.586
- Seok Hoon has a chance. - He has a chance.

2431
01:33:18.586 --> 01:33:22.857
It seems like people wouldn't sing g.o.d or Kyung Ho's songs.

2432
01:33:23.096 --> 01:33:24.857
- We don't know yet. - It's a good start.

2433
01:33:24.857 --> 01:33:27.327
- We don't know yet. - It's not rush hour yet.

2434
01:33:27.327 --> 01:33:29.237
People have to have dinner after work.

2435
01:33:29.237 --> 01:33:30.697
- Right. - They'll come after dinner.

2436
01:33:30.697 --> 01:33:32.036
What time do you expect?

2437
01:33:32.036 --> 01:33:33.836
Maybe 8pm?

2438
01:33:36.176 --> 01:33:39.676
- He's waiting. - Actually, we used to...

2439
01:33:39.676 --> 01:33:42.977
- shoot around university areas. - Yes.

2440
01:33:42.977 --> 01:33:45.216
- Unlike the places we went to, - It's different.

2441
01:33:45.216 --> 01:33:47.687
- I hear familiar songs. - That "Nice to Meet You" song.

2442
01:33:47.687 --> 01:33:50.386
- No one sang it before. - No.

2443
01:33:50.386 --> 01:33:52.727
- We get to hear it in Yeoksam. - You don't know what to expect.

2444
01:33:52.727 --> 01:33:54.626
- They sing old songs too. - I have no idea.

2445
01:33:54.626 --> 01:33:55.857
- They also sing recent songs. - Right.

2446
01:33:55.857 --> 01:33:57.857
- Play Room 3 please. - Why?

2447
01:33:59.527 --> 01:34:00.796
(It's an old song of Cool's.)

2448
01:34:00.796 --> 01:34:02.666
It's because we're in Yeoksam.

2449
01:34:03.466 --> 01:34:05.836
- Put it down, please. - They're singing Cool's song.

2450
01:34:05.836 --> 01:34:07.966
- They're singing Cool's song. - The songs are pretty old.

2451
01:34:07.966 --> 01:34:08.977
It's Cool.

2452
01:34:08.977 --> 01:34:10.977
- "One Candle"! - It's Cool.

2453
01:34:10.977 --> 01:34:13.046
("One Candle" by g.o.d)

2454
01:34:13.046 --> 01:34:14.046
- "One Candle". - Where?

2455
01:34:14.607 --> 01:34:16.746
- Let's go. - Room Three.

2456
01:34:16.777 --> 01:34:18.617
- We haven't started yet. - We haven't started yet.

2457
01:34:18.617 --> 01:34:20.317
- We start at 7pm. - That was close.

2458
01:34:20.317 --> 01:34:21.657
- It's playing. - It's playing.

2459
01:34:21.687 --> 01:34:24.216
- Look at that. - You're the first today, Tae Woo.

2460
01:34:24.286 --> 01:34:25.586
Yeoksam's different.

2461
01:34:25.586 --> 01:34:27.557
They can't miss "One Candle".

2462
01:34:27.786 --> 01:34:30.096
- It's starting. - Let's go.

2463
01:34:30.596 --> 01:34:33.827
(When you're down, rely on me)

2464
01:34:33.827 --> 01:34:34.827
Louder.

2465
01:34:35.536 --> 01:34:38.036
(It makes them dance.)

2466
01:34:38.036 --> 01:34:39.666
It feels like the end of the year.

2467
01:34:39.666 --> 01:34:43.577
("One Candle" resonating in Yeoksam)

2468
01:34:44.706 --> 01:34:47.246
(I will hold your hand)

2469
01:34:47.246 --> 01:34:48.277
Put it down please.

2470
01:34:50.077 --> 01:34:52.346
- Already. - He's getting confident.

2471
01:34:52.346 --> 01:34:53.617
- Stop. - Put it down please.

2472
01:34:53.617 --> 01:34:55.317
It's better for Tae Woo.

2473
01:34:55.317 --> 01:34:57.157
This is what it's like here.

2474
01:34:57.187 --> 01:34:59.657
You can never guess what they're going to sing.

2475
01:34:59.687 --> 01:35:01.956
- Yeoksam is different. - Yeoksam is different.

2476
01:35:01.956 --> 01:35:04.397
- Yeoksam is still in the 90s. - Of course.

2477
01:35:04.397 --> 01:35:06.426
- It's nice. - It's still in the 90s.

2478
01:35:06.426 --> 01:35:07.596
(This place is full of songs of memory.)

2479
01:35:07.897 --> 01:35:09.767
Smile, Kyung Ho.

2480
01:35:09.767 --> 01:35:11.706
He's worried again.

2481
01:35:11.706 --> 01:35:13.466
I don't have any songs in that mood.

2482
01:35:13.937 --> 01:35:17.676
We don't know what it's going to be like,

2483
01:35:17.676 --> 01:35:20.846
but if it's not the town, then we have to consider the season.

2484
01:35:22.176 --> 01:35:24.176
If you don't have any winter songs.

2485
01:35:24.176 --> 01:35:26.416
- Which season do you like? - Which season?

2486
01:35:26.416 --> 01:35:27.987
Is it summer?

2487
01:35:27.987 --> 01:35:29.586
- Hold on. - How about autumn?

2488
01:35:29.586 --> 01:35:31.216
Are you expecting my song to be the last one?

2489
01:35:31.216 --> 01:35:32.586
(Are you expecting my song to be the last one?)

2490
01:35:33.286 --> 01:35:35.157
It's up again. It's g.o.d's song again.

2491
01:35:35.157 --> 01:35:36.197
- Where? - Where?

2492
01:35:36.197 --> 01:35:37.996
"The Reason Why Opposites Attract".

2493
01:35:38.256 --> 01:35:39.697
- Is that Room 2? - Room 3.

2494
01:35:39.697 --> 01:35:40.796
Room 3.

2495
01:35:41.596 --> 01:35:42.996
I think they're g.o.d's fans.

2496
01:35:42.996 --> 01:35:44.867
- They're your fans. - They're your fans for sure.

2497
01:35:44.867 --> 01:35:47.466
- They must be g.o.d's fans. - Wait for me.

2498
01:35:48.376 --> 01:35:49.836
Don't go anywhere.

2499
01:35:49.836 --> 01:35:51.307
They keep singing g.o.d's songs.

2500
01:35:51.307 --> 01:35:54.147
- It's "Romantic Cat". - Look at Room One.

2501
01:35:54.147 --> 01:35:55.617
Yeoksam's different.

2502
01:35:55.617 --> 01:35:57.246
Yeoksam's amazing.

2503
01:35:57.246 --> 01:35:59.286
They're singing "Romantic Cat".

2504
01:35:59.716 --> 01:36:01.447
- They're going like this. - It's Cherry Filter.

2505
01:36:01.617 --> 01:36:03.886
- They're pretty good. - It's still the 20th century...

2506
01:36:03.886 --> 01:36:05.886
- in Yeoksam. - It's up already.

2507
01:36:05.886 --> 01:36:07.687
- "Night after Night". - "Night after Night".

2508
01:36:07.687 --> 01:36:10.956
- That's Room Three. - In Soon I can come too.

2509
01:36:11.397 --> 01:36:15.136
This town works for her too.

2510
01:36:15.496 --> 01:36:17.367
What we know for sure is that it's diverse.

2511
01:36:17.367 --> 01:36:18.536

01:36:20.136 --> 01:36:21.466
(They'll pick the legendary ending singer.)

2514
01:36:22.136 --> 01:36:23.407
(At least you placed 3rd.)

2515
01:36:23.407 --> 01:36:24.407
(Forcefully)

2516
01:36:25.046 --> 01:36:27.376
(I'm going to be the last again.)

2517
01:36:28.716 --> 01:36:30.977
(It's unable to guess. It's never been so nervous.)

2518
01:36:30.977 --> 01:36:33.246
(They're competing for their last pride.)

2519
01:36:34.147 --> 01:36:36.086
(Don't cry even if you place last.)

2520
01:36:37.286 --> 01:36:38.987
(Who will be the final legend?)

2521
01:36:38.987 --> 01:36:40.227
(We'll be back next week.)
